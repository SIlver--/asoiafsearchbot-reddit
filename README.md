#####**What does it do?**

/u/ASOIAFSearchBot will take your requested search term, look through its database, show the total number of occurrences and the first occurrence in each chapter with it's sentence.

Based off of /u/Tokugawa's [idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/253sp9/spoilers_all_i_created_a_spreadsheet_to_make_the/)

#####**How do I call it?**

These are **case-sensitive** so make sure to follow the casing.

>**SearchAll! "Hodor"**

> **SearchAGOT! "Hodor"**

> **SearchACOK! "Hodor"**

> **SearchASOS! "Hodor"** 

> **SearchAFFC! "Hodor"** 

> **SearchADWD! "Hodor"**

> **SearchDE! "Hodor"**

> **SearchPQ! "Hodor"**

#####**What are it's limits?**

Right now it will only display below 30 rows of chapters. If it's above, it will show top 30 most occurring results.

For quotes results, it will only show the first occurrence, this is to avoid spam and hopefully provide context when used in an odd chapter.
