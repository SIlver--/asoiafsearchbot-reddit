INSERT INTO `books` VALUES ('ASOIAF','ACOK',0,'Prologue','Maester Cressen','The comet\'s tail spread across the dawn, a red slash that bled above the crags of Dragonstone like a wound in the pink and purple sky. The maester stood on the windswept balcony outside his chambers. It was here the ravens came, after long flight. Their droppings speckled the gargoyles that rose twelve feet tall on either side of him, a hellhound and a wyvern, two of the thousand that brooded over the walls of the ancient fortress. When first he came to Dragonstone, the army of stone grotesques had made him uneasy, but as the years passed he had grown used to them. Now he thought of them as old friends. The three of them watched the sky together with foreboding. The maester did not believe in omens. And yet... old as he was, Cressen had never seen a comet half so bright, nor yet that color, that terrible color, the color of blood and flame and sunsets. He wondered if his gargoyles had ever seen its like. They had been here so much longer than he had, and would still be here long after he was gone. If stone tongues could speak... Such folly. He leaned against the battlement, the sea crashing beneath him, the black stone rough beneath his fingers. Talking gargoyles and prophecies in the sky. I am an old done man, grown giddy as a child again. Had a lifetime\'s hard-won wisdom fled him along with his health and strength? He was a maester, trained and chained in the great Citadel of Oldtown. What had he come to, when superstition filled his head as if he were an ignorant fieldhand? And yet... and yet... the comet burned even by day now, while pale grey steam rose from the hot vents of Dragonmont behind the castle, and yestermorn a white raven had brought word from the Citadel itself, word long-expected but no less fearful for all that, word of summer\'s end. Omens, all. Too many to deny. What does it all mean? he wanted to cry. \"Maester Cressen, we have visitors.\" Pylos spoke softly, as if loath to disturb Cressen\'s solemn meditations. Had he known what drivel filled his head, he would have shouted. \"The princess would see the white raven.\" Ever correct, Pylos called her princess now, as her lord father was a king. King of a smoking rock in the great salt sea, yet a king nonetheless. \"Her fool is with her.\" The old man turned away from the dawn, keeping a hand on his wyvern to steady himself. \"Help me to my chair and show them in.\" Taking his arm, Pylos led him inside. In his youth, Cressen had walked briskly, but he was not far from his eightieth name day now, and his legs were frail and unsteady. Two years past, he had fallen and shattered a hip, and it had never mended properly. Last year when he took ill, the Citadel had sent Pylos out from Oldtown, mere days before Lord Stannis had closed the isle... to help him in his labors, it was said, but Cressen knew the truth. Pylos had come to replace him when he died. He did not mind. Someone must take his place, and sooner than he would like... He let the younger man settle him behind his books and papers. \"Go bring her. It is ill to keep a lady waiting.\" He waved a hand, a feeble gesture of haste from a man no longer capable of hastening. His flesh was wrinkled and spotted, the skin so papery thin that he could see the web of veins and the shape of bones beneath. And how they trembled, these hands of his that had once been so sure and deft... When Pylos returned the girl came with him, shy as ever. Behind her, shuffling and hopping in that queer sideways walk of his, came her fool. On his head was a mock helm fashioned from an old tin bucket, with a rack of deer antlers strapped to the crown and hung with cowbells. With his every lurching step, the bells rang, each with a different voice, clang-a-dang bong-dong ring-a-ling clong clong clong. \"Who comes to see us so early, Pylos?\" Cressen said. \"It\'s me and Patches, Maester.\" Guileless blue eyes blinked at him. Hers was not a pretty face, alas. The child had her lord father\'s square jut of jaw and her mother\'s unfortunate ears, along with a disfigurement all her own, the legacy of the bout of greyscale that had almost claimed her in the crib. Across half one cheek and well down her neck, her flesh was stiff and dead, the skin cracked and flaking, mottled black and grey and stony to the touch. \"Pylos said we might see the white raven.\" \"Indeed you may,\" Cressen answered. As if he would ever deny her. She had been denied too often in her time. Her name was Shireen. She would be ten on her next name day, and she was the saddest child that Maester Cressen had ever known. Her sadness is my shame, the old man thought, another mark of my failure. \"Maester Pylos, do me a kindness and bring the bird down from the rookery for the Lady Shireen.\" \"It would be my pleasure.\" Pylos was a polite youth, no more than five-and-twenty, yet solemn as a man of sixty. If only he had more humor, more life in him; that was what was needed here. Grim places needed lightening, not solemnity, and Dragonstone was grim beyond a doubt, a lonely citadel in the wet waste surrounded by storm and salt, with the smoking shadow of the mountain at its back. A maester must go where he is sent, so Cressen had come here with his lord some twelve years past, and he had served, and served well. Yet he had never loved Dragonstone, nor ever felt truly at home here. Of late, when he woke from restless dreams in which the red woman figured disturbingly, he often did not know where he was. The fool turned his patched and piebald head to watch Pylos climb the steep iron steps to the rookery. His bells rang with the motion. \"Under the sea, the birds have scales for feathers,\" he said, clang-a-langing. \"I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.\" Even for a fool, Patchface was a sorry thing. Perhaps once he could evoke gales of laughter with a quip, but the sea had taken that power from him, along with half his wits and all his memory. He was soft and obese, subject to twitches and trembles, incoherent as often as not. The girl was the only one who laughed at him now, the only one who cared if he lived or died. An ugly little girl and a sad fool, and maester makes three... now there is a tale to make men weep. \"Sit with me, child.\" Cressen beckoned her closer. \"This is early to come calling, scarce past dawn. You should be snug in your bed.\" \"I had bad dreams,\" Shireen told him. \"About the dragons. They were coming to eat me.\" The child had been plagued by nightmares as far back as Maester Cressen could recall. \"We have talked of this before,\" he said gently. \"The dragons cannot come to life. They are carved of stone, child. In olden days, our island was the westernmost outpost of the great Freehold of Valyria. It was the Valyrians who raised this citadel, and they had ways of shaping stone since lost to us. A castle must have towers wherever two walls meet at an angle, for defense. The Valyrians fashioned these towers in the shape of dragons to make their fortress seem more fear- some, just as they crowned their walls with a thousand gargoyles instead of simple crenellations.\" He took her small pink hand in his own frail spotted one and gave it a gentle squeeze. \"So you see, there is nothing to fear.\" Shireen was unconvinced. \"What about the thing in the sky? Dalla and Matrice were talking by the well, and Dalla said she heard the red woman tell Mother that it was dragonshreath. If the dragons are breathing, doesn\'t that mean they are coming to life?\" The red woman, Maester Cressen thought sourly. It\'s enough that she\'s filled the head of the mother with her madness, must she poison the daughter\'s dreams as well? He would have a stern word with Dalla, warn her not to spread such tales. \"The thing in the sky is a comet, sweet child. A star with a tail, lost in the heavens. It will be gone soon enough, never to be seen again in our lifetimes. Watch and see.\" Shireen gave a brave little nod. \"Mother said the white raven means it\'s not summer anymore.\" \"That is so, my lady. The white ravens fly only from the Citadel.\" Cressen\'s fingers went to the chain about his neck, each link forged from a different metal, each symbolizing his mastery of another branch of learning; the maester\'s collar, mark of his order. In the pride of his youth, he had worn it easily, but now it seemed heavy to him, the metal cold against his skin. \"They are larger than other ravens, and more clever, bred to carry only the most important messages. This one came to tell us that the Conclave has met, considered the reports and measurements made by maesters all over the realm, and declared this great summer done at last. Ten years, two turns, and sixteen days it lasted, the longest summer in living memory.\" \"Will it get cold now?\" Shireen was a summer child, and had never known true cold. \"In time,\" Cressen replied. \"If the gods are good, they will grant us a warm autumn and bountiful harvests, so we might prepare for the winter to come.\" The smallfolk said that a long summer meant an even longer winter, but the maester saw no reason to frighten the child with such tales. Patchface rang his bells. \"It is always summer under the sea,\" he intoned. \"The merwives wear nennymoans in their hair and weave gowns of silver seaweed. I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.\" Shireen giggled. \"I should like a gown of silver seaweed.\" \"Under the sea, it snows up,\" said the fool, \"and the rain is dry as bone. I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.\" \"Will it truly snow?\" the child asked. \"It will,\" Cressen said. But not for years yet, I pray, and then not for long. \"Ah, here is Pylos with the bird.\" Shireen gave a cry of delight. Even Cressen had to admit the bird made an impressive sight, white as snow and larger than any hawk, with the bright black eyes that meant it was no mere albino, but a truebred white raven of the Citadel. \"Here,\" he called. The raven spread its wings, leapt into the air, and flapped noisily across the room to land on the table beside him. \"I\'ll see to your breakfast now,\" Pylos announced. Cressen nodded. \"This is the Lady Shireen,\" he told the raven. The bird bobbed its pale head up and down, as if it were bowing. \"Lady,\" it croaked. \"Lady.\" The child\'s mouth gaped open. \"It talks!\" \"A few words. As I said, they are clever, these birds.\" \"Clever bird, clever man, clever clever fool,\" said Patchface, jangling. \"Oh, clever clever clever fool.\" He began to sing. \"The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord,\" he sang, hopping from one foot to the other and back again. \"The shadows come to stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my lord.\" He jerked his head with each word, the bells in his antlers sending up a clangor. The white raven screamed and went flapping away to perch on the iron railing of the rookery stairs. Shireen seemed to grow smaller. \"He sings that all the time. I told him to stop but he won\'t. It makes me scared. Make him stop.\" And how do I do that? the old man wondered. Once I might have silenced him forever, but now... Patchface had come to them as a boy. Lord Steffon of cherished memory had found him in Volantis, across the narrow sea. The king-the old king, Aerys II Targaryen, who had not been quite so mad in those days, had sent his lordship to seek a bride for Prince Rhaegar, who had no sisters to wed. \"We have found the most splendid fool,\" he wrote Cressen, a fortnight before he was to return home from his fruitless mission. \"Only a boy, yet nimble as a monkey and witty as a dozen courtiers. He juggles and riddles and does magic, and he can sing prettily in four tongues. We have bought his freedom and hope to bring him home with us. Robert will be delighted with him, and perhaps in time he will even teach Stannis how to laugh.\" It saddened Cressen to remember that letter. No one had ever taught Stannis how to laugh, least of all the boy Patchface. The storm came up suddenly, howling, and Shipbreaker Bay proved the truth of its name. The lord\'s two-masted galley Windproud broke up within sight of his castle. From its parapets his two eldest sons had watched as their father\'s ship was smashed against the rocks and swallowed by the waters. A hundred oarsmen and sailors went down with Lord Steffon Baratheon and his lady wife, and for days thereafter every tide left a fresh crop of swollen corpses on the strand below Storm\'s End. The boy washed up on the third day. Maester Cressen had come down with the rest, to help put names to the dead. When they found the fool he was naked, his skin white and wrinkled and powdered with wet sand. Cressen had thought him another corpse, but when Jornmy grabbed his ankles to drag him off to the burial wagon, the boy coughed water and sat up. To his dying day, Jornmy had sworn that Patchface\'s flesh was clammy cold. No one ever explained those two days the fool had been lost in the sea. The fisherfolk liked to say a mermaid had taught him to breathe water in return for his seed. Patchface himself had said nothing. The witty, clever lad that Lord Steffon had written of never reached Storm\'s End; the boy they found was someone else, broken in body and mind, hardly capable of speech, much less of wit. Yet his fool\'s face left no doubt of who he was. It was the fashion in the Free City of Volantis to tattoo the faces of slaves and servants; from neck to scalp the boy\'s skin had been patterned in squares of red and green motley. \"The wretch is mad, and in pain, and no use to anyone, least of all himself,\" declared old Ser Harbert, the castellan of Storm\'s End in those years. \"The kindest thing you could do for that one is fill his cup with the milk of the poppy. A painless sleep, and there\'s an end to it. He\'d bless you if he had the wit for it.\" But Cressen had refused, and in the end he had won. Whether Patchface had gotten any joy of that victory he could not say, not even today, so many years later. \"The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord\" the fool sang on, swinging his head and making his bells clang and clatter. Bong dong, ring-a-ling, bong dong. \"Lord,\" the white raven shrieked. \"Lord, lord, lord.\" \"A fool sings what he will,\" the maester told his anxious princess. \"You must not take his words to heart. On the morrow he may remember another song, and this one will never be heard again.\" He can sing prettily in four tongues, Lord Steffon had written... Pylos strode through the door. \"Maester, pardons.\" \"You have forgotten the porridge,\" Cressen said, amused. That was most unlike Pylos. \"Maester, Ser Davos returned last night. They were talking of it in the kitchen. I thought you would want to know at once.\" \"Davos... last night, you say? Where is he?\" \"With the king. They have been together most of the night.\" There was a time when Lord Stannis would have woken him, no matter the hour, to have him there to give his counsel. \"I should have been told,\" Cressen complained. \"I should have been woken.\" He disentangled his fingers from Shireen\'s. \"Pardons, my lady, but I must speak with your lord father. Pylos, give me your arm. There are too many steps in this castle, and it seems to me they add a few every night, just to vex me.\" Shireen and Patchface followed them out, but the child soon grew restless with the old man\'s creeping pace and dashed ahead, the fool lurching after her with his cowbells clanging madly. Castles are not friendly places for the frail, Cressen was reminded as he descended the turnpike stairs of Sea Dragon Tower. Lord Stannis would be found in the Chamber of the Painted Table, atop the Stone Drum, Dragonstone\'s central keep, so named for the way its ancient walls boomed and rumbled during storms. To reach him they must cross the gallery, pass through the middle and inner walls with their guardian gargoyles and black iron gates, and ascend more steps than Cressen cared to contemplate. Young men climbed steps two at a time; for old men with bad hips, everyone was a torment. But Lord Stannis would not think to come to him, so the maester resigned himself to the ordeal. He had Pylos to help him, at the least, and for that he was grateful. Shuffling along the gallery, they passed before a row of tall arched windows with commanding views of the outer bailey, the curtain wall, and the fishing village beyond. in the yard, archers were firing at practice butts to the call of \"Notch, draw, loose.\" Their arrows made a sound like a flock of birds taking wing. Guardsmen strode the wallwalks, peering between the gargoyles on the host camped without. The morning air was hazy with the smoke of cookfires, as three thousand men sat down to break their fasts beneath the banners of their lords. Past the sprawl of the camp, the anchorage was crowded with ships. No craft that had come within sight of Dragonstone this past half year had been allowed to leave again. Lord Stannis\'s Fury, a triple-decked war galley of three hundred oars, looked almost small beside some of the big-bellied carracks and cogs that surrounded her. The guardsmen outside the Stone Drum knew the maesters by sight, and passed them through. \"Wait here,\" Cressen told Pylos, within. \"It\'s best I see him alone.\" \"It is a long climb, Maester.\" Cressen smiled. \"You think I have forgotten? I have climbed these steps so often I know each one by name.\" Halfway up, he regretted his decision. He had stopped to catch his breath and ease the pain in his hip when he heard the scuff of boots on stone, and came face-to-face with Ser Davos Seaworth, descending. Davos was a slight man, his low birth written plain upon a common face. A well-worn green cloak, stained by salt and spray and faded from the sun, draped his thin shoulders, over brown doublet and breeches that matched brown eyes and hair. About his neck a pouch of worn leather hung from a thong. His small beard was well peppered with grey, and he wore a leather glove on his maimed left hand. When he saw Cressen, he checked his descent. \"Ser Davos,\" the maester said. \"When did you return?\" \"In the black of morning. My favorite time.\" It was said that no one had ever handled a ship by night half so well as Davos Shorthand. Before Lord Stannis had knighted him, he had been the most notorious and elusive smuggler in all the Seven Kingdoms. \"And?\" The man shook his head. \"It is as you warned him. They will not rise, Maester. Not for him. They do not love him.\" No, Cressen thought. Nor will they ever. He is strong, able, just... aye, just past the point of wisdom... yet it is not enough. It has never been enough. \"You spoke to them all?\" \"All? No. Only those that would see me. They do not love me either, these highborns. To them I\'ll always be the Onion Knight.\" His left hand closed, stubby fingers locking into a fist; Stannis had hacked the ends off at the last joint, all but the thumb. \"I broke bread with Gulian Swann and old Penrose, and the Tarths consented to a midnight meeting in a grove. The others-well, Beric Dondarrion is gone missing, some say dead, and Lord Caron is with Renly. Bryce the Orange, of the Rainbow Guard.\" \"The Rainbow Guard?\" \"Renly\'s made his own Kingsguard,\" the onetime smuggler explained, \"but these seven don\'t wear white. Each one has his own color. Loras Tyrell\'s their Lord Commander.\" It was just the sort of notion that would appeal to Renly Baratheon; a splendid new order of knighthood, with gorgeous new raiment to proclaim it. Even as a boy, Renly had loved bright colors and rich fabrics, and he had loved his games as well. \"Look at me!\" he would shout as he ran laughing through the halls of Storm\'s End. \"Look at me, I\'m a dragon,\" or \"Look at me, I\'m a wizard,\" or \"Look at me, look at me, I\'m the rain god.\" The bold little boy with wild black hair and laughing eyes was a man grown now, one-and-twenty, and still he played his games. Look at me, I\'m a king, Cressen thought sadly. Oh, Renly, Renly, dear sweet child, do you know what you are doing? And would you care if you did? Is there anyone who cares for him but me? \"What reasons did the lords give for their refusals?\" he asked Ser Davos. \"Well, as to that, some gave me soft words and some blunt, some made excuses, some promises, some only lied.\" He shrugged. \"In the end words are just wind.\" \"You could bring him no hope?\" \"Only the false sort, and I\'d not do that,\" Davos said. \"He had the truth from me.\" Maester Cressen remembered the day Davos had been knighted, after the siege of Storm\'s End. Lord Stannis and a small garrison had held the castle for close to a year, against the great host of the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne. Even the sea was closed against them, watched day and night by Redwyne galleys flying the burgundy banners of the Arbor. Within Storm\'s End, the horses had long since been eaten, the dogs and cats were gone, and the garrison was down to roots and rats. Then came a night when the moon was new and black clouds hid the stars. Cloaked in that darkness, Davos the smuggler had dared the Redwyne cordon and the rocks of Shipbreaker Bay alike. His little ship had a black hull, black sails, black oars, and a hold crammed with onions and salt fish. Little enough, yet it had kept the garrison alive long enough for Eddard Stark to reach Storm\'s End and break the siege. Lord Stannis had rewarded Davos with choice lands on Cape Wrath, a small keep, and a knight\'s honors... but he had also decreed that he lose a joint of each finger on his left hand, to pay for all his years of smuggling. Davos had submitted, on the condition that Stannis wield the knife himself; he would accept no punishment from lesser hands. The lord had used a butcher\'s cleaver, the better to cut clean and true. Afterward, Davos had chosen the name Seaworth for his new-made house, and he took for his banner a black ship on a pale grey field-with an onion on its sails. The onetime smuggler was fond of saying that Lord Stannis had done him a boon, by giving him four less fingernails to clean and trim. No, Cressen thought, a man like that would give no false hope, nor soften a hard truth. \"Ser Davos, truth can be a bitter draught, even for a man like Lord Stannis. He thinks only of returning to King\'s Landing in the fullness of his power, to tear down his enemies and claim what is rightfully his. Yet now...\" \"if he takes this meager host to King\'s Landing, it will be only to die. He does not have the numbers. I told him as much, but you know his pride.\" Davos held up his gloved hand. \"My fingers will grow back before that man bends to sense.\" The old man sighed. \"You have done all you could. Now I must add my voice to yours.\" Wearily, he resumed his climb. Lord Stannis Baratheon\'s refuge was a great round room with walls of bare black stone and four tall narrow windows that looked out to the four points of the compass. In the center of the chamber was the great table from which it took its name, a massive slab of carved wood fashioned at the command of Aegon Targaryen in the days before the Conquest. The Painted Table was more than fifty feet long, perhaps half that wide at its widest point, but less than four feet across at its narrowest. Aegon\'s carpenters had shaped it after the land of Westeros, sawing out each bay and peninsula until the table nowhere ran straight. On its surface, darkened by near three hundred years of varnish, were painted the Seven Kingdoms as they had been in Aegon\'s day; rivers and mountains, castles and cities, lakes and forests. There was a single chair in the room, carefully positioned in the precise place that Dragonstone occupied off the coast of Westeros, and raised up to give a good view of the tabletop. Seated in the chair was a man in a tight-laced leather jerkin and breeches of roughspun brown wool. When Maester Cressen entered, he glanced up. \"I knew you would come, old man, whether I summoned you or no.\" There was no hint of warmth in his voice; there seldom was. Stannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone and by the grace of the gods rightful heir to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, was broad of shoulder and sinewy of limb, with a tightness to his face and flesh that spoke of leather cured in the sun until it was as tough as steel. Hard was the word men used when they spoke of Stannis, and hard he was. Though he was not yet five-and-thirty, only a fringe of thin black hair remained on his head, circling behind his ears like the shadow of a crown. His brother, the late King Robert, had grown a beard in his final years. Maester Cressen had never seen it, but they said it was a wild thing, thick and flerce. As if in answer, Stannis kept his own whiskers cropped tight and short. They lay like a blue-black shadow across his square jaw and the bony hollows of his cheeks. His eyes were open wounds beneath his heavy brows, a blue as dark as the sea by night. His mouth would have given despair to even the drollest of fools; it was a mouth made for frowns and scowls and sharply worded commands, all thin pale lips and clenched muscles, a mouth that had forgotten how to smile and had never known how to laugh. Sometimes when the world grew very still and silent of a night, Maester Cressen fancied he could hear Lord Stannis grinding his teeth half a castle away. \"Once you would have woken me,\" the old man said. \"Once you were young. Now you are old and sick, and need your sleep.\" Stannis had never learned to soften his speech, to dissemble or flatter; he said what he thought, and those that did not like it could be damned. \"I knew you\'d learn what Davos had to say soon enough. You always do, don\'t you?\" \"I would be of no help to you if I did not,\" Cressen said. \"I met Davos on the stair.\" \"And he told all, I suppose? I should have had the man\'s tongue shortened along with his fingers.\" \"He would have made you a poor envoy then.\" \"He made me a poor envoy in any case. The storm lords will not rise for me. It seems they do not like me, and the justice of my cause means nothing to them. The cravenly ones will sit behind their walls waiting to see how the wind rises and who is likely to triumph. The bold ones have already declared for Renly. For Renly!\" He spat out the name like poison on his tongue. \"Your brother has been the Lord of Storm\'s End these past thirteen years. These lords are his sworn bannermen-\" \"His,\" Stannis broke in, \"when by rights they should be mine. I never asked for Dragonstone. I never wanted it. I took it because Robert\'s enemies were here and he commanded me to root them out. I built his fleet and did his work, dutiful as a younger brother should be to an elder, as Renly should be to me. And what was Robert\'s thanks? He names me Lord of Dragonstone, and gives Storm\'s End and its incomes to Renly. Storm\'s End belonged to House Baratheon for three hundred years; by rights it should have passed to me when Robert took the Iron Throne.\" It was an old grievance, deeply felt, and never more so than now. Here was the heart of his lord\'s weakness; for Dragonstone, old and strong though it was, commanded the allegiance of only a handful of lesser lords, whose stony island holdings were too thinly peopled to yield up the men that Stannis needed. Even with the sellswords he had brought across the narrow sea from the Free Cities of Myr and Lys, the host camped outside his walls was far too small to bring down the power of House Lannister. \"Robert did you an injustice,\" Maester Cressen replied carefully, \"yet he had sound reasons. Dragonstone had long been the seat of House Targaryen. He needed a man\'s strength to rule here, and Renly was but a child.\" \"He is a child still,\" Stannis declared, his anger ringing loud in the empty hall, \"a thieving child who thinks to snatch the crown off my brow. What has Renly ever done to earn a throne? He sits in council and jests with Littlefinger, and at tourneys he dons his splendid suit of armor and allows himself to be knocked off his horse by a better man. That is the sum of my brother Renly, who thinks he ought to be a king. I ask you, why did the gods inflict me with brothers?\" \"I cannot answer for the gods.\" \"You seldom answer at all these days, it seems to me. Who maesters for Renly? Perchance I should send for him, I might like his counsel better. What do you think this maester said when my brother decided to steal my crown? What counsel did your colleague offer to this traitor blood of mine?\" \"It would surprise me if Lord Renly sought counsel, Your Grace.\" The youngest of Lord Steffon\'s three sons had grown into a man bold but heedless, who acted from impulse rather than calculation. In that, as in so much else, Renly was like his brother Robert, and utterly unlike Stannis. \"Your Grace,\" Stannis repeated bitterly. \"You mock me with a king\'s style, yet what am I king of? Dragonstone and a few rocks in the narrow sea, there is my kingdom.\" He descended the steps of his chair to stand before the table, his shadow falling across the mouth of the Blackwater Rush and the painted forest where King\'s Landing now stood. There he stood, brooding over the realm he sought to claim, so near at hand and yet so far away. \"Tonight I am to sup with my lords bannermen, such as they are. Celtigar, Velaryon, Bar Emmon, the whole paltry lot of them. A poor crop, if truth be told, but they are what my brothers have left me. That Lysene pirate Salladhor Saan will be there with the latest tally of what I owe him, and Morosh the Myrman will caution me with talk of tides and autumn gales, while Lord Sunglass mutters piously of the will of the Seven. Celtigar will want to know which storm lords are joining us. Velaryon will threaten to take his levies home unless we strike at once. What am I to tell them? What must I do now?\" \"Your true enemies are the Lannisters, my lord,\" Maester Cressen answered. \"If you and your brother were to make common cause against them-\" \"I will not treat with Renly,\" Stannis answered in a tone that brooked no argument. \"Not while he calls himself a king.\" \"Not Renly, then,\" the maester yielded. His lord was stubborn and proud; when he had set his mind, there was no changing it. \"Others might serve your needs as well. Eddard Stark\'s son has been proclaimed King in the North, with all the power of Winterfell and Riverrun behind him.\" \"A green boy,\" said Stannis, \"and another false king. Am I to accept a broken realm?\" \"Surely half a kingdom is better than none,\" Cressen said, \"and if you help the boy avenge his father\'s murder-\" \"Why should I avenge Eddard Stark? The man was nothing to me. Oh, Robert loved him, to be sure. Loved him as a brother, how often did I hear that? I was his brother, not Ned Stark, but you would never have known it by the way he treated me. I held Storm\'s End for him, watching good men starve while Mace Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne feasted within sight of my walls. Did Robert thank me? No. He thanked Stark, for lifting the siege when we were down to rats and radishes. I built a fleet at Robert\'s command, took Dragonstone in his name. Did he take my hand and say, Well done, brother, whatever should I do without you? No, he blamed me for letting Willem Darry steal away Viserys and the babe, as if I could have stopped it. I sat on his council for fifteen years, helping Jon Arryn rule his realm while Robert drank and whored, but when Jon died, did my brother name me his Hand? No, he went galloping off to his dear friend Ned Stark, and offered him the honor. And small good it did either of them. \" \"Be that as it may, my lord,\" Maester Cressen said gently. \"Great wrongs have been done you, but the past is dust. The future may yet be won if you join with the Starks. There are others you might sound out as well. What of Lady Arryn? If the queen murdered her husband, surely she will want justice for him. She has a young son, Jon Arryn\'s heir. If you were to betroth Shireen to him-\" \"The boy is weak and sickly,\" Lord Stannis objected. \"Even his father saw how it was, when he asked me to foster him on Dragonstone. Service as a page might have done him good, but that damnable Lannister woman had Lord Arryn poisoned before it could be done, and now Lysa hides him in the Eyrie. She\'ll never part with the boy, I promise you that. \" \"Then you must send Shireen to the Eyrie,\" the maester \' urged. \"Dragonstone is a grim home for a child. Let her fool go with her, so she will have a familiar face about her.\" \"Familiar and hideous.\" Stannis furrowed his brow in thought. \"Still... perhaps it is worth the trying...\" \"Must the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms beg for help from widow women and usurpers?\" a woman\'s voice asked sharply. Maester Cressen turned \' and bowed his head. \"My lady,\" he said, chagrined that he had not heard her enter. Lord Stannis scowled. \"I do not beg. Of anyone. Mind you remember that, woman.\" \"I am pleased to hear it, my lord.\" Lady Selyse was as tall as her husband, thin of body and thin of face, with prominent ears, a sharp nose, and the faintest hint of a mustache on her upper lip. She plucked it daily and cursed it regularly, yet it never failed to return. Her eyes were pale, her mouth stern, her voice a whip. She cracked it now. \"Lady Arryn owes you her allegiance, as do the Starks, your brother Renly, and all the rest. You are their one true king. It would not be fitting to plead and bargain with them for what is rightfully yours by the grace of god.\" God, she said, not gods. The red woman had won her, heart and soul, turning her from the gods of the Seven Kingdoms, both old and new, to worship the one they called the Lord of Light. \"Your god can keep his grace,\" said Lord Stannis, who did not share his wife\'s fervent new faith. \"It\'s swords I need, not blessings. Do you have an army hidden somewhere that you\'ve not told me of?\" There was no affection in his tone. Stannis had always been uncomfortable around women, even his own wife. When he had gone to King\'s Landing to sit on Robert\'s council, he had left Selyse on Dragonstone with their daughter. His letters had been few, his visits fewer; he did his duty in the marriage bed once or twice a year, but took no joy in it, and the sons he had once hoped for had never come. \"My brothers and uncles and cousins have armies,\" she told him. \"House Florent will rally to your banner.\" \"House Florent can field two thousand swords at best.\" It was said that Stannis knew the strength of every house in the Seven Kingdoms. \"And you have a deal more faith in your brothers and uncles than I do, my lady. The Florent lands lie too close to Highgarden for your lord uncle to risk Mace Tyrell\'s wrath.\" \"There is another way.\" Lady Selyse moved closer. \"Look out your windows, my lord. There is the sign you have waited for, blazoned on the sky. Red, it is, the red of flame, red for the fiery heart of the true god. it is his banner-and yours! See how it unfurls across the heavens like a dragon\'s hot breath, and you the Lord of Dragonstone. It means your time has come, Your Grace. Nothing is more certain. You are meant to sail from this desolate rock as Aegon the Conqueror once sailed, to sweep all before you as he did. only say the word, and embrace the power of the Lord of Light.\" \"How many swords will the Lord of Light put into my hand?\" Stannis demanded again. \"All you need,\" his wife promised, \"The swords of Storm\'s End and Highgarden for a start, and all their lords bannermen.\" \"Davos would tell you different,\" Stannis said. \"Those swords are sworn to Renly. They love my charming young brother, as they once loved Robert... and as they have never loved me.\" \"Yes,\" she answered, \"but if Renly should die...\" Stannis looked at his lady with narrowed eyes, until Cressen could not hold his tongue. \"it is not to be thought. Your Grace, whatever follies Renly has committed-\" \"Follies? I call them treasons.\" Stannis turned back to his wife. \"My brother is young and strong, and he has a vast host around him, and these rainbow knights of his.\" \"Melisandre has gazed into the flames, and seen him dead.\" Cressen was horrorstruck. \"Fratricide... my lord, this is evil, unthinkable... please, listen to me.\" Lady Selyse gave him a measured look. \"And what will you tell him, Maester? How he might win half a kingdom if he goes to the Starks on his knees and sells our daughter to Lysa Arryn?\" \"I have heard your counsel, Cressen,\" Lord Stannis said. \"Now I will hear hers. You are dismissed.\" Maester Cressen bent a stiff knee. He could feel Lady Selyse\'s eyes on his back as he shuffled slowly across the room. By the time he reached the bottom of the steps it was all he could do to stand erect. \"Help me,\" he said to Pylos. When he was safe back in his own rooms, Cressen sent the younger man away and limped to his balcony once more, to stand between his gargoyles and stare out to sea. One of Salladhor Saan\'s warships was sweeping past the castle, her gaily striped hull slicing through the greygreen waters as her oars rose and fell. He watched until she vanished behind a headland. Would that my fears could vanish so easily. Had he lived so long for this? When a maester donned his collar, he put aside the hope of children, yet Cressen had oft felt a father nonetheless. Robert, Stannis, Renly... three sons he had raised after the angry sea claimed Lord Steffon. Had he done so ill that now he must watch one kill the other? He could not allow it, would not allow it. The woman was the heart of it. Not the Lady Selyse, the other one. The red woman, the servants had named her, afraid to speak her name. \"I will speak her name,\" Cressen told his stone hellhound. \"Melisandre. Her.\" Melisandre of Asshai, sorceress, shadowbinder, and priestess to R\'hllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow. Melisandre, whose madness must not be allowed to spread beyond Dragonstone. His chambers seemed dim and gloomy after the brightness of the morning. With fumbling hands, the old man lit a candle and carried it to the workroom beneath the rookery stair, where his ointments, potions, and medicines stood neatly on their shelves. On the bottom shelf behind a row of salves in squat clay jars he found a vial of indigo glass, no larger than his little finger. It rattled when he shook it. Cressen blew away a layer of dust and carried it back to his table. Collapsing into his chair, he pulled the stopper and spilled out the vial\'s contents. A dozen crystals, no larger than seeds, rattled across the parchment he\'d been reading. They shone like jewels in the candlelight, so purple that the maester found himself thinking that he had never truly seen the color before. The chain around his throat felt very heavy. He touched one of the crystals lightly with the tip of his little finger. Such a small thing to hold the power of life and death. It was made from a certain plant that grew only on the islands of the Jade Sea, half a world away. The leaves had to be aged, and soaked in a wash of limes and sugar water and certain rare spices from the Summer Isles. Afterward they could be discarded, but the potion must be thickened with ash and allowed to crystallize. The process was slow and difficult, the necessaries costly and hard to acquire. The alchemists of Lys knew the way of it, though, and the Faceless Men of Braavos... and the maesters of his order as well, though it was not something talked about beyond the walls of the Citadel. All the world knew that a maester forged his silver link when he learned the art of healing-but the world preferred to forget that men who knew how to heal also knew how to kill. Cressen no longer recalled the name the Asshaii gave the leaf, or the Lysene poisoners the crystal. In the Citadel, it was simply called the strangler. Dissolved in wine, it would make the muscles of a man\'s throat clench tighter than any fist, shutting off his windpipe. They said a victim\'s face turned as purple as the little crystal seed from which his death was grown, but so too did a man choking on a morsel of food. And this very night Lord Stannis would feast his bannermen, his lady wife... and the red woman, Melisandre of Asshai. I must rest, Maester Cressen told himself. I must have all my strength come dark. My hands must not shake, nor my courage flag. It is a dreadful thing I do, yet it must be done. If there are gods, surely they will forgive me. He had slept so poorly of late. A nap would refresh him for the ordeal ahead. Wearily, he tottered off to his bed. Yet when he closed his eyes, he could still see the light of the comet, red and flery and vividly alive amidst the darkness of his dreams. Perhaps it is my comet, he thought drowsily at the last, just before sleep took him. An omen of blood, foretelling murder... yes... When he woke it was full dark, his bedchamber was black, and every joint in his body ached. Cressen pushed himself up, his head throbbing. Clutching for his cane, he rose unsteady to his feet. So late, he thought. They did not summon me. He was always summoned for feasts, seated near the salt, close to Lord Stannis. His lord\'s face swam up before him, not the man he was but the boy he had been, standing cold in the shadows while the sun shone on his elder brother. Whatever he did, Robert had done first, and better. Poor boy... he must hurry, for his sake. The maester found the crystals where he had left them, and scooped them off the parchment. Cressen owned no hollow rings, such as the poisoners of Lys were said to favor, but a myriad of pockets great and small were sewn inside the loose sleeves of his robe. He secreted the strangler seeds in one of them, threw open his door, and called, \"Pylos? Where are you?\" When he heard no reply, he called again, louder. \"Pylos, I need help.\" Still there came no answer. That was queer; the young maester had his cell only a half turn down the stair, within easy earshot. In the end, Cressen had to shout for the servants. \"Make haste,\" he told them. \"I have slept too long. They will be feasting by now... drinking... I should have been woken.\" What had happened to Maester Pylos? Truly, he did not understand. Again he had to cross the long gallery. A night wind whispered through the great windows, sharp with the smell of the sea. Torches flickered along the walls of Dragonstone, and in the camp beyond, he could see hundreds of cookfires burning, as if a field of stars had fallen to the earth. Above, the comet blazed red and malevolent. I am too old and wise to fear such things, the maester told himself. The doors to the Great Hall were set in the mouth of a stone dragon. He told the servants to leave him outside. It would be better to enter alone; he must not appear feeble. Leaning heavily on his cane, Cressen climbed the last few steps and hobbled beneath the gateway teeth. A pair of guardsmen opened the heavy red doors before him, unleashing a sudden blast of noise and light. Cressen stepped down into the dragon\'s maw. Over the clatter of knife and plate and the low mutter of table talk, he heard Patchface singing,\"... dance, my lord, dance my lord,\" to the accompaniment of jangling cowbells. The same dreadful song he\'d sung this morning. \"The shadows come to stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my lord.\" The lower tables were crowded with knights, archers, and sellsword captains, tearing apart loaves of black bread to soak in their fish stew. Here there was no loud laughter, no raucous shouting such as marred the dignity of other men\'s feasts; Lord Stannis did not permit such. Cressen made his way toward the raised platform where the lords sat with the king. He had to step wide around Patchface. Dancing, his bells ringing, the fool neither saw nor heard his approach. As he hopped from one leg to the other, Patchface lurched into Cressen, knocking his cane out from under him. They went crashing down together amidst the rushes in a tangle of arms and legs, while a sudden gale of laughter went up around them. No doubt it was a comical sight. Patchface sprawled half on top of him, motley fool\'s face pressed close to his own. He had lost his tin helm with its antlers and bells. \"Under the sea, you fall up,\" he declared. \"I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.\" Giggling, the fool rolled off, bounded to his feet, and did a little dance. Trying to make the best of it, the maester smiled feebly and struggled to rise, but his hip was in such pain that for a moment he was half afraid that he had broken it all over again. He felt strong hands grasp him under the arms and lift him back to his feet. \"Thank you, ser,\" he murmured, turning to see which knight had come to his aid... \"Maester,\" said Lady Melisandre, her deep voice flavored with the music of the jade Sea. \"You ought take more care.\" As ever, she wore red head to heel, a long loose gown of flowing silk as bright as fire, with dagged sleeves and deep slashes in the bodice that showed glimpses of a darker bloodred fabric beneath. Around her throat was a red gold choker tighter than any maester\'s chain, ornamented with a single great ruby. Her hair was not the orange or strawberry color of common red-haired men, but a deep burnished copper that shone in the light of the torches. Even her eyes were red... but her skin was smooth and white, unblemished, pale as cream. Slender she was, graceful, taller than most knights, with full breasts and narrow waist and a heart-shaped face. Men\'s eyes that once found her did not quickly look away, not even a maester\'s eyes. Many called her beautiful. She was not beautiful. She was red, and terrible, and red. \"I... thank you, my lady.\" \"A man your age must look to where he steps,\" Melisandre said courteously. \"The night is dark and full of terrors.\" He knew the phrase, some prayer of her faith. It makes no matter, I have a faith of my own. \"Only children fear the dark,\" he told her. Yet even as he said the words, he heard Patchface take up his song again. \"The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord. \" \"Now here is a riddle,\" Melisandre said. \"A clever fool and a foolish wise man.\" Bending, she picked up Patchface\'s helm from where it had fallen and set it on Cressen\'s head. The cowbells rang softly as the tin bucket slid down over his ears. \"A crown to match your chain, Lord Maester,\" she announced. All around them, men were laughing. Cressen pressed his lips together and fought to still his rage. She thought he was feeble and helpless, but she would learn otherwise before the night was done. Old he might be, yet he was still a maester of the Citadel. \"I need no crown but truth,\" he told her, removing the fool\'s helm from his head. \"There are truths in this world that are not taught at Oldtown.\" Melisandre turned from him in a swirl of red silk and made her way back to the high table, where King Stannis and his queen were seated. Cressen handed the antlered tin bucket back to Patchface, and made to follow. Maester Pylos sat in his place. The old man could only stop and stare. \"Maester Pylos,\" he said at last. \"You... you did not wake me.\" \"His Grace commanded me to let you rest.\" Pylos had at least the grace to blush. \"He told me you were not needed here.\" Cressen looked over the knights and captains and lords sitting silent. Lord Celtigar, aged and sour, wore a mantle patterned with red crabs picked out in garnets. Handsome Lord Velaryon chose sea-green silk, the white gold seahorse at his throat matching his long fair hair. Lord Bar Emmon, that plump boy of fourteen, was swathed in purple velvet trimmed with white seal, Ser Axell Florent remained homely even in russet and fox fur, pious Lord Sunglass wore moonstones at throat and wrist and finger, and the Lysene captain Salladhor Saan was a sunburst of scarlet satin, gold, and jewels. Only Ser Davos dressed simply, in brown doublet and green wool mantle, and only Ser Davos met his gaze, with pity in his eyes. \"You are too ill and too confused to be of use to me, old man.\" It sounded so like Lord Stannis\'s voice, but it could not be, it could not. \"Pylos will counsel me henceforth. Already he works with the ravens, since you can no longer climb to the rookery. I will not have you kill yourself in my service.\" Maester Cressen blinked. Stannis, my lord, my sad sullen boy, son I never had, you must not do this, don\'t you know how I have cared for you, lived for you, loved you despite all? Yes, loved you, better than Robert even, or Renly, for you were the one unloved, the one who needed me most. Yet all he said was, \"As you command, my lord, but... but I am hungry. Might not I have a place at your table?\" At your side, I belong at your side... Ser Davos rose from the bench. \"I should be honored if the maester would sit here beside me, Your Grace.\" \"As you will.\" Lord Stannis turned away to say something to Melisandre, who had seated herself at his right hand, in the place of high honor. Lady Selyse was on his left, flashing a smile as bright and brittle as her jewels. Too far, Cressen thought dully, looking at where Ser Davos was seated. Half of the lords bannermen were between the smuggler and the high table. I must be closer to her if I am to get the strangler into her cup, yet how? Patchface was capering about as the maester made his slow way around the table to Davos Seaworth. \"Here we eat fish,\" the fool declared happily, waving a cod about like a scepter. \"Under the sea, the fish eat us. I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.\" Ser Davos moved aside to make room on the bench. \"We all should be in motley tonight,\" he said gloomily as Cressen seated himself, \"for this is fool\'s business we\'re about. The red woman has seen victory in her flames, so Stannis means to press his claim, no matter what the numbers. Before she\'s done we\'re all like to see what Patchface saw, I fear the bottom of the sea.\" Cressen slid his hands up into his sleeves as if for warmth. His fingers found the hard lumps the crystals made in the wool. \"Lord Stannis.\" Stannis turned from the red woman, but it was Lady Selyse who replied. \"King Stannis. You forget yourself, Maester.\" \"He is old, his mind wanders,\" the king told her gruffly. \"What is it, Cressen? Speak your mind.\" \"As you intend to sail, it is vital that you make common cause with Lord Stark and Lady Arryn... \"I make common cause with no one,\" Stannis Baratheon said. \"No more than light makes common cause with darkness.\" Lady Selyse took his hand. Stannis nodded. \"The Starks seek to steal half my kingdom, even as the Lannisters have stolen my throne and my own sweet brother the swords and service and strongholds that are mine by rights. They are all usurpers, and they are all my enemies.\" I have lost him, Cressen thought, despairing. If only he could somehow approach Melisandre unseen... he needed but an instant\'s access to her cup. \"You are the rightful heir to your brother Robert, the true Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men,\" he said desperately, \"but even so, you cannot hope to triumph without allies.\" \"He has an ally,\" Lady Selyse said. \"Whllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow.\" \"Gods make uncertain allies at best,\" the old man insisted, \"and that one has no power here.\" \"You think not?\" The ruby at Melisandre\'s throat caught the light as she turned her head, and for an instant it seemed to glow bright as the comet. \"If you will speak such folly, Maester, you ought to wear your crown again.\" \"Yes,\" Lady Selyse agreed. \"Patches\'s helm. It suits you well, old man. Put it on again, I command you.\" \"Under the sea, no one wears hats,\" Patchface said. \"I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.\" Lord Stannis\'s eyes were shadowed beneath his heavy brow, his mouth tight as his jaw worked silently. He always ground his teeth when he was angry. \"Fool,\" he growled at last, \"my lady wife commands. Give Cressen your helm.\" No, the old maester thought, this is not you, not your way, you were always just, always hard yet never cruel, never, you did not understand mockery, no more than you understood laughter. Patchface danced closer, his cowbells ringing, clang-a-lang, ding-ding, clink-clank-clink-clank. The maester sat silent while the fool set the antlered bucket on his brow. Cressen bowed his head beneath the weight. His bells clanged. \"Perhaps he ought sing his counsel henceforth,\" Lady Selyse said. \"You go too far, woman,\" Lord Stannis said. \"He is an old man, and he\'s served me well.\" And I will serve you to the last, my sweet lord, my poor lonely son, Cressen thought, for suddenly he saw the way. Ser Davos\'s cup was before him, still half-full of sour red. He found a hard flake of crystal in his sleeve, held it tight between thumb and forefinger as he reached for the cup. Smooth motions, deft, I must not fumble now, he prayed, and the gods were kind. In the blink of an eye, his fingers were empty. His hands had not been so steady for years, nor half so fluid. Davos saw, but no one else, he was certain. Cup in hand, he rose to his feet. \"Mayhaps I have been a fool. Lady Melisandre, will you share a cup of wine with me? A cup in honor of your god, your Lord of Light? A cup to toast his power? \" The red woman studied him. \"If you wish.\" He could feel them all watching him. Davos clutched at him as he left the bench, catching his sleeve with the fingers that Lord Stannis had shortened. \"What are you doing?\" he whispered. \"A thing that must be done,\" Maester Cressen answered, \"for the sake of the realm, and the soul of my lord.\" He shook off Davos\'s hand, spilling a drop of wine on the rushes. She met him beneath the high table with every man\'s eyes upon them. But Cressen saw only her. Red silk, red eyes, the ruby red at her throat, red lips curled in a faint smile as she put her hand atop his own, around the cup. Her skin felt hot, feverish. \"It is not too late to spill the wine, Maester.\" \"No,\" he whispered hoarsely. \"No.\" \"As you will.\" Melisandre of Asshai took the cup from his hands and drank long and deep. There was only half a swallow of wine remaining when she offered it back to him. \"And now you.\" His hands were shaking, but he made himself be strong. A maester of the Citadel must not be afraid. The wine was sour on his tongue. He let the empty cup drop from his fingers to shatter on the floor. \"He does have power here, my lord,\" the woman said. \"And fire cleanses.\" At her throat, the ruby shimmered redly. Cressen tried to reply, but his words caught in his throat. His cough became a terrible thin whistle as he strained to suck in air. Iron fingers tightened round his neck. As he sank to his knees, still he shook his head, denying her, denying her power, denying her magic, denying her god. And the cowbells peeled in his antlers, singing fool, fool, fool while the red woman looked down on him in pity, the candle flames dancing in her red red eyes.');
INSERT INTO `books` VALUES ('ASOIAF','ACOK',1,'Arya I','Arya Stark','At Winterfell they had called her \"Arya Horseface\" and she\'d thought nothing could be worse, but that was before the orphan boy Lommy Greenhands had named her \"Lumpyhead.\" Her head felt lumpy when she touched it. When Yoren had dragged her into that alley she\'d thought he meant to kill her, but the sour old man had only held her tight, sawing through her mats and tangles with his dagger. She remembered how the breeze sent the fistfuls of dirty brown hair skittering across the paving stones, toward the sept where her father had died. \"I\'m taking men and boys from the city,\" Yoren growled as the sharp steel scraped at her head. \"Now you hold still, boy.\" By the time he had finished, her scalp was nothing but tufts and stubble. Afterward he told her that from there to Winterfell she\'d be Arry the orphan boy. \"Gate shouldn\'t be hard, but the road\'s another matter. You got a long way to go in bad company. I got thirty this time, men and boys all bound for the Wall, and don\'t be thinking they\'re like that bastard brother o\' yours.\" He shook her. \"Lord Eddard gave me pick o\' the dungeons, and I didn\'t find no little lordlings down there. This lot, half o\' them would turn you over to the queen quick as spit for a pardon and maybe a few silvers. The other half\'d do the same, only they\'d rape you first. So you keep to yourself and make your water in the woods, alone. That\'ll be the hardest part, the pissing, so don\'t drink no more\'n you need.\" Leaving King\'s Landing was easy, just like he\'d said. The Lannister guardsmen on the gate were stopping everyone, but Yoren called one by name and their wagons were waved through. No one spared Arya a glance. They were looking for a highborn girl, daughter of the King\'s Hand, not for a skinny boy with his hair chopped off. Arya never looked back. She wished the Rush would rise and wash the whole city away, Flea Bottom and the Red Keep and the Great Sept and everything, and everyone too, especially Prince Joffrey and his mother. But she knew it wouldn\'t, and anyhow Sansa was still in the city and would wash away too. When she remembered that, Arya decided to wish for Winterfell instead. Yoren was wrong about the pissing, though. That wasn\'t the hardest part at all; Lommy Greenhands and Hot Pie were the hardest part. Orphan boys. Yoren had plucked some from the streets with promises of food for their bellies and shoes for their feet. The rest he\'d found in chains. \"The Watch needs good men,\" he told them as they set out, \"but you lot will have to do.\" Yoren had taken grown men from the dungeons as well, thieves and poachers and rapers and the like. The worst were the three he\'d found in the black cells who must have scared even him, because he kept them fettered hand and foot in the back of a wagon, and vowed they\'d stay in irons all the way to the Wall. One had no nose, only the hole in his face where it had been cut off, and the gross fat bald one with the pointed teeth and the weeping sores on his cheeks had eyes like nothing human. They took five wagons out of King\'s Landing, laden with supplies for the Wall: hides and bolts of cloth, bars of pig iron, a cage of ravens, books and paper and ink, a bale of sourleaf, jars of oil, and chests of medicine and spices. Teams of plow horses pulled the wagons, and Yoren had bought two coursers and a half-dozen donkeys for the boys. Arya would have preferred a real horse, but the donkey was better than riding on a wagon. The men paid her no mind, but she was not so lucky with the boys. She was two years younger than the youngest orphan, not to mention smaller and skinnier, and Lommy and Hot Pie took her silence to mean she was scared, or stupid, or deaf. \"Look at that sword Lumpyhead\'s got there,\" Lommy said one morning as they made their plodding way past orchards and wheat fields. He\'d been a dyer\'s apprentice before he was caught stealing, and his arms were mottled green to the elbow. When he laughed he brayed like the donkeys they were riding. \"Where\'s a gutter rat like Lumpyhead get him a sword?\" Arya chewed her lip sullenly. She could see the back of Yoren\'s faded black cloak up ahead of the wagons, but she was determined not to go crying to him for help. \"Maybe he\'s a little squire,\" Hot Pie put in. His mother had been a baker before she died, and he\'d pushed her cart through the streets all day, shouting \"Hot pies! Hot pies!\" \"Some lordy lord\'s little squire boy, that\'s it.\" \"He ain\'t no squire, look at him. I bet that\'s not even a real sword. I bet it\'s just some play sword made of tin.\" Arya hated them making fun of Needle. \"It\'s castle-forged steel, you stupid,\" she snapped, turning in the saddle to glare at them, \"and you better shut your mouth.\" The orphan boys hooted. \"Where\'d you get a blade like that, Lumpyface?\" Hot Pie wanted to know. \"Lumpyhead,\" corrected Lommy. \"He prob\'ly stole it.\" \"I did not!\" she shouted. Jon Snow had given her Needle. Maybe she had to let them call her Lumpyhead, but she wasn\'t going to let them call Jon a thief. \"If he stole it, we could take it off him,\" said Hot Pie. \"It\'s not his anyhow. I could use me a sword like that.\" Lommy egged him on. \"Go on, take it off him, I dare you.\" Hot Pie kicked his donkey, riding closer. \"Hey, Lumpyface, you gimme that sword.\" His hair was the color of straw, his fat face all sunburnt and peeling. \"You don\'t know how to use it.\" Yes I do, Arya could have said. I killed a boy, a fat boy like you, I stabbed him in the belly and he died, and I\'ll kill you too if you don\'t let me alone. Only she did not dare. Yoren didn\'t know about the stableboy, but she was afraid of what he might do if he found out. Arya was pretty sure that some of the other men were killers too, the three in the manacles for sure, but the queen wasn\'t looking for them, so it wasn\'t the same. \"Look at him,\" brayed Lommy Greenhands. \"I bet he\'s going to cry now. You want to cry, Lumpyhead?\" She had cried in her sleep the night before, dreaming of her father. Come morning, she\'d woken red-eyed and dry, and could not have shed another tear if her life had hung on it. \"He\'s going to wet his pants,\" Hot Pie suggested. \"Leave him be,\" said the boy with the shaggy black hair who rode behind them. Lommy had named him the Bull, on account of this horned helm he had that he polished all the time but never wore. Lommy didn\'t dare mock the Bull. He was older, and big for his age, with a broad chest and strong-looking arms. \"You better give Hot Pie the sword, Arry,\" Lommy said. \"Hot Pie wants it bad. He kicked a boy to death. He\'ll do the same to you, I bet.\" \"I knocked him down and I kicked him in the balls, and I kept kicking him there until he was dead,\" Hot Pie boasted. \"I kicked him all to pieces. His balls were broke open and bloody and his cock turned black. You better gimme the sword.\" Arya slid her practice sword from her belt. \"You can have this one,\" she told Hot Pie, not wanting to fight. \"That\'s just some stick.\" He rode nearer and tried to reach over for Needle\'s hilt. Arya made the stick whistle as she laid the wood across his donkey\'s hindquarters. The animal hawed and bucked, dumping Hot Pie on the ground. She vaulted off her own donkey and poked him in the gut as he tried to get up and he sat back down with a grunt. Then she whacked him across the face and his nose made a crack like a branch breaking. Blood dribbled from his nostrils. When Hot Pie began to wail, Arya whirled toward Lommy Greenhands, who was sitting on his donkey openmouthed. \"You want some sword too?\" she yelled, but he didn\'t. He raised dyed green hands in front of his face and squealed at her to get away. The Bull shouted, \"Behind you,\" and Arya spun. Hot Pie was on his knees, his fist closing around a big jagged rock. She let him throw it, ducking her head as it sailed past. Then she flew at him. He raised a hand and she hit it, and then his cheek, and then his knee. He grabbed for her, and she danced aside and bounced the wood off the back of his head. He fell down and got up and stumbled after her, his red face all smeared with dirt and blood. Arya slid into a water dancer\'s stance and waited. When he came close enough, she lunged, right between his legs, so hard that if her wooden sword had had a point it would have come out between his butt cheeks. By the time Yoren pulled her off him, Hot Pie was sprawled out on the ground with his breeches brown and smelly, crying as Arya whapped him over and over and over. \"Enough,\" the black brother roared, prying the stick sword from her fingers, \"you want to kill the fool?\" When Lommy and some others started to squeal, the old man turned on them too. \"Shut your mouths, or I\'ll be shutting them for you. Any more o\' this, I\'ll tie you lot behind the wagons and drag you to the Wall.\" He spat. \"And that goes twice for you, Arry. You come with me, boy. Now\" They were all looking at her, even the three chained and manacled in the back of the wagon. The fat one snapped his pointy teeth together and hissed, but Arya ignored him. The old man dragged her well off the road into a tangle of trees, cursing and muttering all the while. \"If I had a thimble o\' sense, I would\'ve left you in King\'s Landing. You hear me, boy?\" He always snarled that word, putting a bite in it so she would be certain to hear. \"Unlace your breeches and pull \'em down. Go on, there\'s no one here to see. Do it.\" Sullenly, Arya did as he said. \"Over there, against the oak. Yes, like that.\" She wrapped her arms around the trunk and pressed her face to the rough wood. \"You scream now. You scream loud.\" I won\'t, Arya thought stubbornly, but when Yoren laid the wood against the back of her bare thighs, the shriek burst out of her anyway. \"Think that hurt?\" he said. \"Try this one.\" The stick came whistling. Arya shrieked again, clutching the tree to keep from falling. \"One more.\" She held on tight, chewing her lip, flinching when she heard it coming. The stroke made her jump and howl. I won\'t cry, she thought, I won\'t do that. I\'m a Stark of Winterfell, our sigil is the direwolf, direwolves don\'t cry. She could feel a thin trickle of blood running down her left leg. Her thighs and cheeks were ablaze with pain. \"Might be I got your attention now,\" Yoren said. \"Next time you take that stick to one of your brothers, you\'ll get twice what you give, you hear me? Now cover yourself.\" They\'re not my brothers, Arya thought as she bent to yank up her breeches, but she knew better than to say so. Her hands fumbled with her belt and laces. Yoren was looking at her. \"You hurt?\" Calm as still water, she told herself, the way Syrio Forel had taught her. \"Some.\" He spat. \"That pie boy\'s hurting worse. It wasn\'t him as killed your father, girl, nor that thieving Lommy neither. Hitting them won\'t bring him back.\" \"I know,\" Arya muttered sullenly. \"Here\'s something you don\'t know. It wasn\'t supposed to happen like it did. I was set to leave, wagons bought and loaded, and a man comes with a boy for me, and a purse of coin, and a message, never mind who it\'s from. Lord Eddard\'s to take the black, he says to me, wait, he\'ll be going with you. Why d\'you think I was there? Only something went queer.\" \"Joffrey,\" Arya breathed. \"Someone should kill him!\" \"Someone will, but it won\'t be me, nor you neither.\" Yoren tossed back her stick sword. \"Got sourleaf back at the wagons,\" he said as they made their way back to the road. \"You\'ll chew some, it\'ll help with the sting.\" It did help, some, though the taste of it was foul and it made her spit look like blood. Even so, she walked for the rest of that day, and the day after, and the day after that, too raw to sit a donkey. Hot Pie was worse off; Yoren had to shift some barrels around so he could lie in the back of a wagon on some sacks of barley, and he whimpered every time the wheels hit a rock. Lommy Greenhands wasn\'t even hurt, yet he stayed as far away from Arya as he could get. \"Every time you look at him, he twitches,\" the Bull told her as she walked beside his donkey. She did not answer. It seemed safer not to talk to anyone. That night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground, staring up at the great red comet. The comet was splendid and scary all at once. \"The Red Sword,\" the Bull named it; he claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too, only it wasn\'t a new sword, it was Ice, her father\'s greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard\'s blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King\'s justice had cut off his head. Yoren had made her look away when it happened, yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, after. When at last she slept, she dreamed of home. The kingsroad wound its way past Winterfell on its way to the Wall, and Yoren had promised he\'d leave her there with no one any wiser about who she\'d been. She yearned to see her mother again, and Robb and Bran and Rickon... but it was Jon Snow she thought of most. She wished somehow they could come to the Wall before Winterfell, so Jon might muss up her hair and call her \"little sister.\" She\'d tell him, \"I missed you,\" and he\'d say it too at the very same moment, the way they always used to say things together. She would have liked that. She would have liked that better than anything.');

INSERT INTO `books` VALUES ('ASOIAF','ADWD',1,'Tyrion I','Tyrion Lannister','He drank his way across the narrow sea. The ship was small, his cabin smaller, but the captain would not allow him abovedecks. The rocking of the deck beneath his feet made his stomach heave, and the wretched food tasted even worse when retched back up. But why did he need salt beef, hard cheese, and bread crawling with worms when he had wine to nourish him? It was red and sour, very strong. Sometimes he heaved the wine up too, but there was always more. \"The world is full of wine,\" he muttered in the dankness of his cabin. His father never had any use for drunkards, but what did that matter? His father was dead. He\'d killed him. A bolt in the belly, my lord, and all for you. If only I was better with a crossbow, I would have put it through that cock you made me with, you bloody bastard. Belowdecks, there was neither night nor day. Tyrion marked time by the comings and goings of the cabin boy who brought the meals he did not eat. The boy always brought a brush and bucket too, to clean up. \"Is this Dornish wine?\" Tyrion asked him once, as he pulled a stopper from a skin. \"It reminds me of a certain snake I knew. A droll fellow, till a mountain fell on him.\" The cabin boy did not answer. He was an ugly boy, though admittedly more comely than a certain dwarf with half a nose and a scar from eye to chin. \"Have I offended you?\" Tyrion asked, as the boy was scrubbing. \"Were you commanded not to talk to me? Or did some dwarf diddle your mother?\" That went unanswered too. \"Where are we sailing? Tell me that.\" Jaime had made mention of the Free Cities, but had never said which one. \"Is it Braavos? Tyrosh? Myr?\" Tyrion would sooner have gone to Dorne. Myrcella is older than Tommen, by Dornish law the Iron Throne is hers. I will help her claim her rights, as Prince Oberyn suggested. Oberyn was dead, though, his head smashed to bloody ruin by the armored fist of Ser Gregor Clegane. And without the Red Viper to urge him on, would Doran Martell even consider such a chancy scheme? He might clap me in chains instead and hand me back to my sweet sister. The Wall might be safer. Old Bear Mormont said the Night\'s Watch had need of men like Tyrion. Mormont might be dead, though. By now Slynt may be the lord commander. That butcher\'s son was not like to have forgotten who sent him to the Wall. Do I really want to spend the rest of my life eating salt beef and porridge with murderers and thieves? Not that the rest of his life would last very long. Janos Slynt would see to that. The cabin boy wet his brush and scrubbed on manfully. \"Have you ever visited the pleasure houses of Lys?\" the dwarf inquired. \"Might that be where whores go?\" Tyrion could not seem to recall the Valyrian word for whore, and in any case it was too late. The boy tossed his brush back in his bucket and took his leave. The wine has blurred my wits. He had learned to read High Valyrian at his maester\'s knee, though what they spoke in the Nine Free Cities ... well, it was not so much a dialect as nine dialects on the way to becoming separate tongues. Tyrion had some Braavosi and a smattering of Myrish. In Tyrosh he should be able to curse the gods, call a man a cheat, and order up an ale, thanks to a sellsword he had once known at the Rock. At least in Dorne they speak the Common Tongue. Like Dornish food and Dornish law, Dornish speech was spiced with the flavors of the Rhoyne, but a man could comprehend it. Dorne, yes, Dorne for me. He crawled into his bunk, clutching that thought like a child with a doll. Sleep had never come easily to Tyrion Lannister. Aboard that ship it seldom came at all, though from time to time he managed to drink sufficient wine to pass out for a while. At least he did not dream. He had dreamed enough for one small life. And of such follies: love, justice, friendship, glory. As well dream of being tall. It was all beyond his reach, Tyrion knew now. But he did not know where whores go. \"Wherever whores go,\" his father had said. His last words, and what words they were. The crossbow thrummed, Lord Tywin sat back down, and Tyrion Lannister found himself waddling through the darkness with Varys at his side. He must have clambered back down the shaft, two hundred and thirty rungs to where orange embers glowed in the mouth of an iron dragon. He remembered none of it. Only the sound the crossbow made, and the stink of his father\'s bowels opening. Even in his dying, he found a way to shit on me. Varys had escorted him through the tunnels, but they never spoke until they emerged beside the Blackwater, where Tyrion had won a famous victory and lost a nose. That was when the dwarf turned to the eunuch and said, \"I\'ve killed my father,\" in the same tone a man might use to say, \"I\'ve stubbed my toe.\" The master of whisperers had been dressed as a begging brother, in a moth-eaten robe of brown roughspun with a cowl that shadowed his smooth fat cheeks and bald round head. \"You should not have climbed that ladder,\" he said reproachfully. \"Wherever whores go.\" Tyrion had warned his father not to say that word. If I had not loosed, he would have seen my threats were empty. He would have taken the crossbow from my hands, as once he took Tysha from my arms. He was rising when I killed him. \"I killed Shae too,\" he confessed to Varys. \"You knew what she was.\" \"I did. But I never knew what he was.\" Varys tittered. \"And now you do.\" I should have killed the eunuch as well. A little more blood on his hands, what would it matter? He could not say what had stayed his dagger. Not gratitude. Varys had saved him from a headsman\'s sword, but only because Jaime had compelled him. Jaime ... no, better not to think of Jaime. He found a fresh skin of wine instead and sucked at it as if it were a woman\'s breast. The sour red ran down his chin and soaked through his soiled tunic, the same one he had been wearing in his cell. The deck was swaying beneath his feet, and when he tried to rise it lifted sideways and smashed him hard against a bulkhead. A storm, he realized, or else I am even drunker than I knew. He retched the wine up and lay in it a while, wondering if the ship would sink. Is this your vengeance, Father? Has the Father Above made you his Hand? \"Such are the wages of the kinslayer,\" he said as the wind howled outside. It did not seem fair to drown the cabin boy and the captain and all the rest for something he had done, but when had the gods ever been fair? And around about then, the darkness gulped him down. When he stirred again, his head felt like to burst and the ship was spinning round in dizzy circles, though the captain was insisting that they\'d come to port. Tyrion told him to be quiet and kicked feebly as a huge bald sailor tucked him under one arm and carried him squirming to the hold, where an empty wine cask awaited him. It was a squat little cask, and a tight fit even for a dwarf. Tyrion pissed himself in his struggles, for all the good it did. He was crammed face-first into the cask with his knees pushed up against his ears. The stub of his nose itched horribly, but his arms were pinned so tightly that he could not reach to scratch it. A palanquin fit for a man of my stature, he thought as they hammered shut the lid. He could hear voices shouting as he was hoisted up. Every bounce cracked his head against the bottom of the cask. The world went round and round as the cask rolled downward, then stopped with a crash that made him want to scream. Another cask slammed into his, and Tyrion bit his tongue. That was the longest journey he had ever taken, though it could not have lasted more than half an hour. He was lifted and lowered, rolled and stacked, upended and righted and rolled again. Through the wooden staves he heard men shouting, and once a horse whickered nearby. His stunted legs began to cramp, and soon hurt so badly that he forgot the hammering in his head. It ended as it had begun, with another roll that left him dizzy and more jouncing. Outside, strange voices were speaking in a tongue he did not know. Someone started pounding on the top of the cask and the lid cracked open suddenly. Light came flooding in, and cool air as well. Tyrion gasped greedily and tried to stand, but only managed to knock the cask over sideways and spill himself out onto a hard-packed earthen floor. Above him loomed a grotesque fat man with a forked yellow beard, holding a wooden mallet and an iron chisel. His bedrobe was large enough to serve as a tourney pavilion, but its loosely knotted belt had come undone, exposing a huge white belly and a pair of heavy breasts that sagged like sacks of suet covered with coarse yellow hair. He reminded Tyrion of a dead sea cow that had once washed up in the caverns under Casterly Rock. The fat man looked down and smiled. \"A drunken dwarf,\" he said, in the Common Tongue of Westeros. \"A rotting sea cow.\" Tyrion\'s mouth was full of blood. He spat it at the fat man\'s feet. They were in a long, dim cellar with barrel-vaulted ceilings, its stone walls spotted with nitre. Casks of wine and ale surrounded them, more than enough drink to see a thirsty dwarf safely through the night. Or through a life. \"You are insolent. I like that in a dwarf.\" When the fat man laughed, his flesh bounced so vigorously that Tyrion was afraid he might fall and crush him. \"Are you hungry, my little friend? Weary?\" \"Thirsty.\" Tyrion struggled to his knees. \"And filthy.\" The fat man sniffed. \"A bath first, just so. Then food and a soft bed, yes? My servants shall see to it.\" His host put the mallet and chisel aside. \"My house is yours. Any friend of my friend across the water is a friend to Illyrio Mopatis, yes.\" And any friend of Varys the Spider is someone I will trust just as far as I can throw him. The fat man made good on the promised bath, though. No sooner did Tyrion lower himself into the hot water and close his eyes than he was fast asleep. He woke naked on a goose-down feather bed so soft it felt as if he had been swallowed by a cloud. His tongue was growing hair and his throat was raw, but his cock was as hard as an iron bar. He rolled from the bed, found a chamber pot, and commenced to filling it, with a groan of pleasure. The room was dim, but there were bars of yellow sunlight showing between the slats of the shutters. Tyrion shook the last drops off and waddled over patterned Myrish carpets as soft as new spring grass. Awkwardly he climbed the window seat and flung the shutters open to see where Varys and the gods had sent him. Beneath his window six cherry trees stood sentinel around a marble pool, their slender branches bare and brown. A naked boy stood on the water, poised to duel with a bravo\'s blade in hand. He was lithe and handsome, no older than sixteen, with straight blond hair that brushed his shoulders. So lifelike did he seem that it took the dwarf a long moment to realize he was made of painted marble, though his sword shimmered like true steel. Across the pool stood a brick wall twelve feet high, with iron spikes along its top. Beyond that was the city. A sea of tiled rooftops crowded close around a bay. He saw square brick towers, a great red temple, a distant manse upon a hill. In the far distance, sunlight shimmered off deep water. Fishing boats were moving across the bay, their sails rippling in the wind, and he could see the masts of larger ships poking up along the shore. Surely one is bound for Dorne, or for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. He had no means to pay for passage, though, nor was he made to pull an oar. I suppose I could sign on as a cabin boy and earn my way by letting the crew bugger me up and down the narrow sea. He wondered where he was. Even the air smells different here. Strange spices scented the chilly autumn wind, and he could hear faint cries drifting over the wall from the streets beyond. It sounded something like Valyrian, but he did not recognize more than one word in five. Not Braavos, he concluded, nor Tyrosh. Those bare branches and the chill in the air argued against Lys and Myr and Volantis as well. When he heard the door opening behind him, Tyrion turned to confront his fat host. \"This is Pentos, yes?\" \"Just so. Where else?\" Pentos. Well, it was not King\'s Landing, that much could be said for it. \"Where do whores go?\" he heard himself ask. \"Whores are found in brothels here, as in Westeros. You will have no need of such, my little friend. Choose from amongst my servingwomen. None will dare refuse you.\" \"Slaves?\" the dwarf asked pointedly. The fat man stroked one of the prongs of his oiled yellow beard, a gesture Tyrion found remarkably obscene. \"Slavery is forbidden in Pentos, by the terms of the treaty the Braavosi imposed on us a hundred years ago. Still, they will not refuse you.\" Illyrio gave a ponderous half bow. \"But now my little friend must excuse me. I have the honor to be a magister of this great city, and the prince has summoned us to session.\" He smiled, showing a mouth full of crooked yellow teeth. \"Explore the manse and grounds as you like, but on no account stray beyond the walls. It is best that no man knows that you were here.\" \"Were? Have I gone somewhere?\" \"Time enough to speak of that this evening. My little friend and I shall eat and drink and make great plans, yes?\" \"Yes, my fat friend,\" Tyrion replied. He thinks to use me for his profit. It was all profit with the merchant princes of the Free Cities. \"Spice soldiers and cheese lords,\" his lord father called them, with contempt. Should a day ever dawn when Illyrio Mopatis saw more profit in a dead dwarf than a live one, Tyrion would find himself packed into another wine cask by dusk. It would be well if I was gone before that day arrives. That it would arrive he did not doubt; Cersei was not like to forget him, and even Jaime might be vexed to find a quarrel in Father\'s belly. A light wind was riffling the waters of the pool below, all around the naked swordsman. It reminded him of how Tysha would riffle his hair during the false spring of their marriage, before he helped his father\'s guardsmen rape her. He had been thinking of those guardsmen during his flight, trying to recall how many there had been. You would think he might remember that, but no. A dozen? A score? A hundred? He could not say. They had all been grown men, tall and strong ... though all men were tall to a dwarf of thirteen years. Tysha knew their number. Each of them had given her a silver stag, so she would only need to count the coins. A silver for each and a gold for me. His father had insisted that he pay her too. A Lannister always pays his debts. \"Wherever whores go,\" he heard Lord Tywin say once more, and once more the bowstring thrummed. The magister had invited him to explore the manse. He found clean clothes in a cedar chest inlaid with lapis and mother-of-pearl. The clothes had been made for a small boy, he realized as he struggled into them. The fabrics were rich enough, if a little musty, but the cut was too long in the legs and too short in the arms, with a collar that would have turned his face as black as Joffrey\'s had he somehow contrived to get it fastened. Moths had been at them too. At least they do not stink of vomit. Tyrion began his explorations with the kitchen, where two fat women and a potboy watched him warily as he helped himself to cheese, bread, and figs. \"Good morrow to you, fair ladies,\" he said with a bow. \"Do you know where whores go?\" When they did not respond, he repeated the question in High Valyrian, though he had to say courtesan in place of whore. The younger, fatter cook gave him a shrug that time. He wondered what they would do if he took them by the hand and dragged them to his bedchamber. None will dare refuse you, Illyrio claimed, but somehow Tyrion did not think he meant these two. The younger woman was old enough to be his mother, and the older was likely her mother. Both were near as fat as Illyrio, with teats that were larger than his head. I could smother myself in flesh. There were worse ways to die. The way his lord father had died, for one. I should have made him shit a little gold before expiring. Lord Tywin might have been niggardly with his approval and affection, but he had always been open-handed when it came to coin. The only thing more pitiful than a dwarf without a nose is a dwarf without a nose who has no gold. Tyrion left the fat women to their loaves and kettles and went in search of the cellar where Illyrio had decanted him the night before. It was not hard to find. There was enough wine there to keep him drunk for a hundred years; sweet reds from the Reach and sour reds from Dorne, pale Pentoshi ambers, the green nectar of Myr, three score casks of Arbor gold, even wines from the fabled east, from Qarth and Yi Ti and Asshai by the Shadow. In the end, Tyrion chose a cask of strongwine marked as the private stock of Lord Runceford Redwyne, the grandfather of the present Lord of the Arbor. The taste of it was languorous and heady on the tongue, the color a purple so dark that it looked almost black in the dim-lit cellar. Tyrion filled a cup, and a flagon for good measure, and carried them up to the gardens to drink beneath those cherry trees he\'d seen. As it happened, he left by the wrong door and never found the pool he had spied from his window, but it made no matter. The gardens behind the manse were just as pleasant, and far more extensive. He wandered through them for a time, drinking. The walls would have shamed any proper castle, and the ornamental iron spikes along the top looked strangely naked without heads to adorn them. Tyrion pictured how his sister\'s head might look up there, with tar in her golden hair and flies buzzing in and out of her mouth. Yes, and Jaime must have the spike beside her, he decided. No one must ever come between my brother and my sister. With a rope and a grapnel he might be able to get over that wall. He had strong arms and he did not weigh much. He should be able to clamber over, if he did not impale himself on a spike. I will search for a rope on the morrow, he resolved. He saw three gates during his wanderings-the main entrance with its gatehouse, a postern by the kennels, and a garden gate hidden behind a tangle of pale ivy. The last was chained, the others guarded. The guards were plump, their faces as smooth as babies\' bottoms, and every man of them wore a spiked bronze cap. Tyrion knew eunuchs when he saw them. He knew their sort by reputation. They feared nothing and felt no pain, it was said, and were loyal to their masters unto death. I could make good use of a few hundred of mine own, he reflected. A pity I did not think of that before I became a beggar. He walked along a pillared gallery and through a pointed arch, and found himself in a tiled courtyard where a woman was washing clothes at a well. She looked to be his own age, with dull red hair and a broad face dotted by freckles. \"Would you like some wine?\" he asked her. She looked at him uncertainly. \"I have no cup for you, we\'ll have to share.\" The wash-erwoman went back to wringing out tunics and hanging them to dry. Tyrion settled on a stone bench with his flagon. \"Tell me, how far should I trust Magister Illyrio?\" The name made her look up. \"That far?\" Chuckling, he crossed his stunted legs and took a drink. \"I am loath to play whatever part the cheesemonger has in mind for me, yet how can I refuse him? The gates are guarded. Perhaps you might smuggle me out under your skirts? I\'d be so grateful; why, I\'ll even wed you. I have two wives already, why not three? Ah, but where would we live?\" He gave her as pleasant a smile as a man with half a nose could manage. \"I have a niece in Sunspear, did I tell you? I could make rather a lot of mischief in Dorne with Myrcella. I could set my niece and nephew at war, wouldn\'t that be droll?\" The washerwoman pinned up one of Illyrio\'s tunics, large enough to double as a sail. \"I should be ashamed to think such evil thoughts, you\'re quite right. Better if I sought the Wall instead. All crimes are wiped clean when a man joins the Night\'s Watch, they say. Though I fear they would not let me keep you, sweetling. No women in the Watch, no sweet freckly wives to warm your bed at night, only cold winds, salted cod, and small beer. Do you think I might stand taller in black, my lady?\" He filled his cup again. \"What do you say? North or south? Shall I atone for old sins or make some new ones?\" The washerwoman gave him one last glance, picked up her basket, and walked away. I cannot seem to hold a wife for very long, Tyrion reflected. Somehow his flagon had gone dry. Perhaps I should stumble back down to the cellars. The strongwine was making his head spin, though, and the cellar steps were very steep. \"Where do whores go?\" he asked the wash flapping on the line. Perhaps he should have asked the washerwoman. Not to imply that you\'re a whore, my dear, but perhaps you know where they go. Or better yet, he should have asked his father. \"Wherever whores go,\" Lord Tywin said. She loved me. She was a crofter\'s daughter, she loved me and she wed me, she put her trust in me. The empty flagon slipped from his hand and rolled across the yard. Tyrion pushed himself off the bench and went to fetch it. As he did, he saw some mushrooms growing up from a cracked paving tile. Pale white they were, with speckles, and red-ribbed undersides dark as blood. The dwarf snapped one off and sniffed it. Delicious, he thought, and deadly. There were seven of the mushrooms. Perhaps the Seven were trying to tell him something. He picked them all, snatched a glove down from the line, wrapped them carefully, and stuffed them down his pocket. The effort made him dizzy, so afterward he crawled back onto the bench, curled up, and shut his eyes. When he woke again, he was back in his bedchamber, drowning in the goose-down feather bed once more while a blond girl shook his shoulder. \"My lord,\" she said, \"your bath awaits. Magister Illyrio expects you at table within the hour.\" Tyrion propped himself against the pillows, his head in his hands. \"Do I dream, or do you speak the Common Tongue?\" \"Yes, my lord. I was bought to please the king.\" She was blue-eyed and fair, young and willowy. \"I am sure you did. I need a cup of wine.\" She poured for him. \"Magister Illyrio said that I am to scrub your back and warm your bed. My name-\" \"-is of no interest to me. Do you know where whores go?\" She flushed. \"Whores sell themselves for coin.\" \"Or jewels, or gowns, or castles. But where do they go?\" The girl could not grasp the question. \"Is it a riddle, m\'lord? I\'m no good at riddles. Will you tell me the answer?\" No, he thought. I despise riddles, myself. \"I will tell you nothing. Do me the same favor.\" The only part of you that interests me is the part between your legs, he almost said. The words were on his tongue, but somehow never passed his lips. She is not Shae, the dwarf told himself, only some little fool who thinks I play at riddles. If truth be told, even her cunt did not interest him much. I must be sick, or dead. \"You mentioned a bath? We must not keep the great cheesemonger waiting.\" As he bathed, the girl washed his feet, scrubbed his back, and brushed his hair. Afterward she rubbed sweet-smelling ointment into his calves to ease the aches, and dressed him once again in boy\'s clothing, a musty pair of burgundy breeches and a blue velvet doublet lined with cloth-of-gold. \"Will my lord want me after he has eaten?\" she asked as she was lacing up his boots. \"No. I am done with women.\" Whores. The girl took that disappointment too well for his liking. \"If m\'lord would prefer a boy, I can have one waiting in his bed.\" M\'lord would prefer his wife. M\'lord would prefer a girl named Tysha. \"Only if he knows where whores go.\" The girl\'s mouth tightened. She despises me, he realized, but no more than I despise myself. That he had fucked many a woman who loathed the very sight of him, Tyrion Lannister had no doubt, but the others had at least the grace to feign affection. A little honest loathing might be refreshing, like a tart wine after too much sweet. \"I believe I have changed my mind,\" he told her. \"Wait for me abed. Naked, if you please, I\'ll be a deal too drunk to fumble at your clothing. Keep your mouth shut and your thighs open and the two of us should get on splendidly.\" He gave her a leer, hoping for a taste of fear, but all she gave him was revulsion. No one fears a dwarf. Even Lord Tywin had not been afraid, though Tyrion had held a crossbow in his hands. \"Do you moan when you are being fucked?\" he asked the bedwarmer. \"If it please m\'lord.\" \"It might please m\'lord to strangle you. That\'s how I served my last whore. Do you think your master would object? Surely not. He has a hundred more like you, but no one else like me.\" This time, when he grinned, he got the fear he wanted. Illyrio was reclining on a padded couch, gobbling hot peppers and pearl onions from a wooden bowl. His brow was dotted with beads of sweat, his pig\'s eyes shining above his fat cheeks. Jewels danced when he moved his hands; onyx and opal, tiger\'s eye and tourmaline, ruby, amethyst, sapphire, emerald, jet and jade, a black diamond, and a green pearl. I could live for years on his rings, Tyrion mused, though I\'d need a cleaver to claim them. \"Come sit, my little friend.\" Illyrio waved him closer. The dwarf clambered up onto a chair. It was much too big for him, a cushioned throne intended to accommodate the magister\'s massive buttocks, with thick sturdy legs to bear his weight. Tyrion Lannister had lived all his life in a world that was too big for him, but in the manse of Illyrio Mopatis the sense of disproportion assumed grotesque dimensions. I am a mouse in a mammoth\'s lair, he mused, though at least the mammoth keeps a good cellar. The thought made him thirsty. He called for wine. \"Did you enjoy the girl I sent you?\" Illyrio asked. \"If I had wanted a girl I would have asked for one.\" \"If she failed to please ...\" \"She did all that was required of her.\" \"I would hope so. She was trained in Lys, where they make an art of love. The king enjoyed her greatly.\" \"I kill kings, hadn\'t you heard?\" Tyrion smiled evilly over his wine cup. \"I want no royal leavings.\" \"As you wish. Let us eat.\" Illyrio clapped his hands together, and serving men came running. They began with a broth of crab and monkfish, and cold egg lime soup as well. Then came quails in honey, a saddle of lamb, goose livers drowned in wine, buttered parsnips, and suckling pig. The sight of it all made Tyrion feel queasy, but he forced himself to try a spoon of soup for the sake of politeness, and once he had tasted it he was lost. The cooks might be old and fat, but they knew their business. He had never eaten so well, even at court. As he was sucking the meat off the bones of his quail, he asked Illyrio about the morning\'s summons. The fat man shrugged. \"There are troubles in the east. Astapor has fallen, and Meereen. Ghiscari slave cities that were old when the world was young.\" The suckling pig was carved. Illyrio reached for a piece of the crackling, dipped it in a plum sauce, and ate it with his fingers. \"Slaver\'s Bay is a long way from Pentos.\" Tyrion speared a goose liver on the point of his knife. No man is as cursed as the kinslayer, he mused, but I could learn to like this hell. \"This is so,\" Illyrio agreed, \"but the world is one great web, and a man dare not touch a single strand lest all the others tremble. More wine?\" Illyrio popped a pepper into his mouth. \"No, something better.\" He clapped his hands together. At the sound a serving man entered with a covered dish. He placed it in front of Tyrion, and Illyrio leaned across the table to remove the lid. \"Mushrooms,\" the magister announced, as the smell wafted up. \"Kissed with garlic and bathed in butter. I am told the taste is exquisite. Have one, my friend. Have two.\" Tyrion had a fat black mushroom halfway to his mouth, but something in Illyrio\'s voice made him stop abruptly. \"After you, my lord.\" He pushed the dish toward his host. \"No, no.\" Magister Illyrio pushed the mushrooms back. For a heartbeat it seemed as if a mischievous boy was peering out from inside the cheese-monger\'s bloated flesh. \"After you. I insist. Cook made them specially for you.\" \"Did she indeed?\" He remembered the cook, the flour on her hands, heavy breasts shot through with dark blue veins. \"That was kind of her, but ... no.\" Tyrion eased the mushroom back into the lake of butter from which it had emerged. \"You are too suspicious.\" Illyrio smiled through his forked yellow beard. Oiled every morning to make it gleam like gold, Tyrion suspected. \"Are you craven? I had not heard that of you.\" \"In the Seven Kingdoms it is considered a grave breach of hospitality to poison your guest at supper.\" \"Here as well.\" Illyrio Mopatis reached for his wine cup. \"Yet when a guest plainly wishes to end his own life, why, his host must oblige him, no?\" He took a gulp. \"Magister Ordello was poisoned by a mushroom not half a year ago. The pain is not so much, I am told. Some cramping in the gut, a sudden ache behind the eyes, and it is done. Better a mushroom than a sword through your neck, is it not so? Why die with the taste of blood in your mouth when it could be butter and garlic?\" The dwarf studied the dish before him. The smell of garlic and butter had his mouth watering. Some part of him wanted those mushrooms, even knowing what they were. He was not brave enough to take cold steel to his own belly, but a bite of mushroom would not be so hard. That frightened him more than he could say. \"You mistake me,\" he heard himself say. \"Is it so? I wonder. If you would sooner drown in wine, say the word and it shall be done, and quickly. Drowning cup by cup wastes time and wine both.\" \"You mistake me,\" Tyrion said again, more loudly. The buttered mushrooms glistened in the lamplight, dark and inviting. \"I have no wish to die, I promise you. I have ...\" His voice trailed off into uncertainty. What do I have? A life to live? Work to do? Children to raise, lands to rule, a woman to love? \"You have nothing,\" finished Magister Illyrio, \"but we can change that.\" He plucked a mushroom from the butter, and chewed it lustily. \"Delicious.\" \"The mushrooms are not poisoned.\" Tyrion was irritated. \"No. Why should I wish you ill?\" Magister Illyrio ate another. \"We must show a little trust, you and I. Come, eat.\" He clapped his hands again. \"We have work to do. My little friend must keep his strength up.\" The serving men brought out a heron stuffed with figs, veal cutlets blanched with almond milk, creamed herring, candied onions, foul-smelling cheeses, plates of snails and sweetbreads, and a black swan in her plumage. Tyrion refused the swan, which reminded him of a supper with his sister. He helped himself to heron and herring, though, and a few of the sweet onions. And the serving men filled his wine cup anew each time he emptied it. \"You drink a deal of wine for such a little man.\" \"Kinslaying is dry work. It gives a man a thirst.\" The fat man\'s eyes glittered like the gemstones on his fingers. \"There are those in Westeros who would say that killing Lord Lannister was merely a good beginning.\" \"They had best not say it in my sister\'s hearing, or they will find themselves short a tongue.\" The dwarf tore a loaf of bread in half. \"And you had best be careful what you say of my family, magister. Kinslayer or no, I am a lion still.\" That seemed to amuse the lord of cheese no end. He slapped a meaty thigh and said, \"You Westerosi are all the same. You sew some beast upon a scrap of silk, and suddenly you are all lions or dragons or eagles. I can take you to a real lion, my little friend. The prince keeps a pride in his menagerie. Would you like to share a cage with them?\" The lords of the Seven Kingdoms did make rather much of their sigils, Tyrion had to admit. \"Very well,\" he conceded. \"A Lannister is not a lion. Yet I am still my father\'s son, and Jaime and Cersei are mine to kill.\" \"How odd that you should mention your fair sister,\" said Illyrio, between snails. \"The queen has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head, no matter how humble his birth.\" It was no more than Tyrion had expected. \"If you mean to take her up on it, make her spread her legs for you as well. The best part of me for the best part of her, that\'s a fair trade.\" \"I would sooner have mine own weight in gold.\" The cheesemonger laughed so hard that Tyrion feared he was about to rupture. \"All the gold in Casterly Rock, why not?\" \"The gold I grant you,\" the dwarf said, relieved that he was not about to drown in a gout of half-digested eels and sweetmeats, \"but the Rock is mine.\" \"Just so.\" The magister covered his mouth and belched a mighty belch. \"Do you think King Stannis will give it to you? I am told he is a great one for the law. Your brother wears the white cloak, so you are heir by all the laws of Westeros.\" \"Stannis might well grant me Casterly Rock,\" said Tyrion, \"but for the small matter of regicide and kinslaying. For those he would shorten me by a head, and I am short enough as I stand. But why would you think I mean to join Lord Stannis?\" \"Why else would you go the Wall?\" \"Stannis is at the Wall?\" Tyrion rubbed at his nose. \"What in seven bloody hells is Stannis doing at the Wall?\" \"Shivering, I would think. It is warmer down in Dorne. Perhaps he should have sailed that way.\" Tyrion was beginning to suspect that a certain freckled washerwoman knew more of the Common Speech than she pretended. \"My niece Myrcella is in Dorne, as it happens. And I have half a mind to make her a queen.\" Illyrio smiled as his serving men spooned out bowls of black cherries in sweet cream for them both. \"What has this poor child done to you that you would wish her dead?\" \"Even a kinslayer is not required to slay all his kin,\" said Tyrion, wounded. \"Queen her, I said. Not kill her.\" The cheesemonger spooned up cherries. \"In Volantis they use a coin with a crown on one face and a death\'s-head on the other. Yet it is the same coin. To queen her is to kill her. Dorne might rise for Myrcella, but Dorne alone is not enough. If you are as clever as our friend insists, you know this.\" Tyrion looked at the fat man with new interest. He is right on both counts. To queen her is to kill her. And I knew that. \"Futile gestures are all that remain to me. This one would make my sister weep bitter tears, at least.\" Magister Illyrio wiped sweet cream from his mouth with the back of a fat hand. \"The road to Casterly Rock does not go through Dorne, my little friend. Nor does it run beneath the Wall. Yet there is such a road, I tell you.\" \"I am an attainted traitor, a regicide, and kinslayer.\" This talk of roads annoyed him. Does he think this is a game? \"What one king does, another may undo. In Pentos we have a prince, my friend. He presides at ball and feast and rides about the city in a palanquin of ivory and gold. Three heralds go before him with the golden scales of trade, the iron sword of war, and the silver scourge of justice. On the first day of each new year he must deflower the maid of the fields and the maid of the seas.\" Illyrio leaned forward, elbows on the table. \"Yet should a crop fail or a war be lost, we cut his throat to appease the gods and choose a new prince from amongst the forty families.\" \"Remind me never to become the Prince of Pentos.\" \"Are your Seven Kingdoms so different? There is no peace in Westeros, no justice, no faith ... and soon enough, no food. When men are starving and sick of fear, they look for a savior.\" \"They may look, but if all they find is Stannis-\" \"Not Stannis. Nor Myrcella.\" The yellow smile widened. \"Another. Stronger than Tommen, gentler than Stannis, with a better claim than the girl Myrcella. A savior come from across the sea to bind up the wounds of bleeding Westeros.\" \"Fine words.\" Tyrion was unimpressed. \"Words are wind. Who is this bloody savior?\" \"A dragon.\" The cheesemonger saw the look on his face at that, and laughed. \"A dragon with three heads.\"');
INSERT INTO `books` VALUES ('ASOIAF','ADWD',2,'Daenerys I','Daenerys Targaryen','She could hear the dead man coming up the steps. The slow, measured sound of footsteps went before him, echoing amongst the purple pillars of her hall. Daenerys Targaryen awaited him upon the ebon bench that she had made her throne. Her eyes were soft with sleep, her silver-gold hair all tousled. \"Your Grace,\" said Ser Barristan Selmy, the lord commander of her Queensguard, \"there is no need for you to see this.\" \"He died for me.\" Dany clutched her lion pelt to her chest. Underneath, a sheer white linen tunic covered her to midthigh. She had been dreaming of a house with a red door when Missandei woke her. There had been no time to dress. \"Khaleesi,\" whispered Irri, \"you must not touch the dead man. It is bad luck to touch the dead.\" \"Unless you killed them yourself.\" Jhiqui was bigger-boned than Irri, with wide hips and heavy breasts. \"That is known.\" \"It is known,\" Irri agreed. Dothraki were wise where horses were concerned, but could be utter fools about much else. They are only girls, besides. Her handmaids were of an age with her-women grown to look at them, with their black hair, copper skin, and almond-shaped eyes, but girls all the same. They had been given to her when she wed Khal Drogo. It was Drogo who had given her the pelt she wore, the head and hide of a hrakkar, the white lion of the Dothraki sea. It was too big for her and had a musty smell, but it made her feel as if her sun-and-stars was still near her. Grey Worm appeared atop the steps first, a torch in hand. His bronze cap was crested with three spikes. Behind him followed four of his Unsullied, bearing the dead man on their shoulders. Their caps had only one spike each, and their faces showed so little they might have been cast of bronze as well. They laid the corpse down at her feet. Ser Barristan pulled back the bloodstained shroud. Grey Worm lowered the torch, so she might see. The dead man\'s face was smooth and hairless, though his cheeks had been slashed open ear to ear. He had been a tall man, blue-eyed and fair of face. Some child of Lys or Old Volantis, snatched off a ship by corsairs and sold into bondage in red Astapor. Though his eyes were open, it was his wounds that wept. There were more wounds than she could count. \"Your Grace,\" Ser Barristan said, \"there was a harpy drawn on the bricks in the alley where he was found ...\" \"... drawn in blood.\" Daenerys knew the way of it by now. The Sons of the Harpy did their butchery by night, and over each kill they left their mark. \"Grey Worm, why was this man alone? Had he no partner?\" By her command, when the Unsullied walked the streets of Meereen by night they always walked in pairs. \"My queen,\" replied the captain, \"your servant Stalwart Shield had no duty last night. He had gone to a ... a certain place ... to drink, and have companionship.\" \"A certain place? What do you mean?\" \"A house of pleasure, Your Grace.\" A brothel. Half of her freedmen were from Yunkai, where the Wise Masters had been famed for training bedslaves. The way of the seven sighs. Brothels had sprouted up like mushrooms all over Meereen. It is all they know. They need to survive. Food was more costly every day, whilst the price of flesh grew cheaper. In the poorer districts between the stepped pyramids of Meereen\'s slaver nobility, there were brothels catering to every conceivable erotic taste, she knew. Even so ... \"What could a eunuch hope to find in a brothel?\" \"Even those who lack a man\'s parts may still have a man\'s heart, Your Grace,\" said Grey Worm. \"This one has been told that your servant Stalwart Shield sometimes gave coin to the women of the brothels to lie with him and hold him.\" The blood of the dragon does not weep. \"Stalwart Shield,\" she said, dry-eyed. \"That was his name?\" \"If it please Your Grace.\" \"It is a fine name.\" The Good Masters of Astapor had not allowed their slave soldiers even names. Some of her Unsullied reclaimed their birth names after she had freed them; others chose new names for themselves. \"Is it known how many attackers fell upon Stalwart Shield?\" \"This one does not know. Many.\" \"Six or more,\" said Ser Barristan. \"From the look of his wounds, they swarmed him from all sides. He was found with an empty scabbard. It may be that he wounded some of his attackers.\" Dany said a silent prayer that somewhere one of the Harpy\'s Sons was dying even now, clutching at his belly and writhing in pain. \"Why did they cut open his cheeks like that?\" \"Gracious queen,\" said Grey Worm, \"his killers had forced the genitals of a goat down the throat of your servant Stalwart Shield. This one removed them before bringing him here.\" They could not feed him his own genitals. The Astapori left him neither root nor stem. \"The Sons grow bolder,\" Dany observed. Until now, they had limited their attacks to unarmed freedmen, cutting them down in the streets or breaking into their homes under the cover of darkness to murder them in their beds. \"This is the first of my soldiers they have slain.\" \"The first,\" Ser Barristan warned, \"but not the last.\" I am still at war, Dany realized, only now I am fighting shadows. She had hoped for a respite from the killing, for some time to build and heal. Shrugging off the lion pelt, she knelt beside the corpse and closed the dead man\'s eyes, ignoring Jhiqui\'s gasp. \"Stalwart Shield shall not be forgotten. Have him washed and dressed for battle and bury him with cap and shield and spears.\" \"It shall be as Your Grace commands,\" said Grey Worm. \"Send men to the Temple of the Graces and ask if any man has come to the Blue Graces with a sword wound. And spread the word that we will pay good gold for the short sword of Stalwart Shield. Inquire of the butchers and the herdsmen, and learn who has been gelding goats of late.\" Perhaps some goatherd would confess. \"Henceforth, no man of mine walks alone after dark.\" \"These ones shall obey.\" Daenerys pushed her hair back. \"Find these cowards for me. Find them, so that I might teach the Harpy\'s Sons what it means to wake the dragon.\" Grey Worm saluted her. His Unsullied closed the shroud once more, lifted the dead man onto their shoulders, and bore him from the hall. Ser Barristan Selmy remained behind. His hair was white, and there were crow\'s-feet at the corners of his pale blue eyes. Yet his back was still un-bent, and the years had not yet robbed him of his skill at arms. \"Your Grace,\" he said, \"I fear your eunuchs are ill suited for the tasks you set them.\" Dany settled on her bench and wrapped her pelt about her shoulders once again. \"The Unsullied are my finest warriors.\" \"Soldiers, not warriors, if it please Your Grace. They were made for the battlefield, to stand shoulder to shoulder behind their shields with their spears thrust out before them. Their training teaches them to obey, fearlessly, perfectly, without thought or hesitation ... not to unravel secrets or ask questions.\" \"Would knights serve me any better?\" Selmy was training knights for her, teaching the sons of slaves to fight with lance and longsword in the Westerosi fashion ... but what good would lances do against cowards who killed from the shadows? \"Not in this,\" the old man admitted. \"And Your Grace has no knights, save me. It will be years before the boys are ready.\" \"Then who, if not Unsullied? Dothraki would be even worse.\" Dothraki fought from horseback. Mounted men were of more use in open fields and hills than in the narrow streets and alleys of the city. Beyond Meereen\'s walls of many-colored brick, Dany\'s rule was tenuous at best. Thousands of slaves still toiled on vast estates in the hills, growing wheat and olives, herding sheep and goats, and mining salt and copper. Meereen\'s storehouses held ample supplies of grain, oil, olives, dried fruit, and salted meat, but the stores were dwindling. So Dany had dispatched her tiny khalasar to subdue the hinterlands, under the command of her three bloodriders, whilst Brown Ben Plumm took his Second Sons south to guard against Yunkish incursions. The most crucial task of all she had entrusted to Daario Naharis, glib-tongued Daario with his gold tooth and trident beard, smiling his wicked smile through purple whiskers. Beyond the eastern hills was a range of rounded sandstone mountains, the Khyzai Pass, and Lhazar. If Daario could convince the Lhazarene to reopen the overland trade routes, grains could be brought down the river or over the hills at need ... but the Lamb Men had no reason to love Meereen. \"When the Stormcrows return from Lhazar, perhaps I can use them in the streets,\" she told Ser Barristan, \"but until then I have only the Unsullied.\" Dany rose. \"You must excuse me, ser. The petitioners will soon be at my gates. I must don my floppy ears and become their queen again. Summon Reznak and the Shavepate, I\'ll see them when I\'m dressed.\" \"As Your Grace commands.\" Selmy bowed. The Great Pyramid shouldered eight hundred feet into the sky, from its huge square base to the lofty apex where the queen kept her private chambers, surrounded by greenery and fragrant pools. As a cool blue dawn broke over the city, Dany walked out onto the terrace. To the west sunlight blazed off the golden domes of the Temple of the Graces, and etched deep shadows behind the stepped pyramids of the mighty. In some of those pyramids, the Sons of the Harpy are plotting new murders even now, and I am powerless to stop them. Viserion sensed her disquiet. The white dragon lay coiled around a pear tree, his head resting on his tail. When Dany passed his eyes came open, two pools of molten gold. His horns were gold as well, and the scales that ran down his back from head to tail. \"You\'re lazy,\" she told him, scratching under his jaw. His scales were hot to the touch, like armor left too long in the sun. Dragons are fire made flesh. She had read that in one of the books Ser Jorah had given her as a wedding gift. \"You should be hunting with your brothers. Have you and Drogon been fighting again?\" Her dragons were growing wild of late. Rhaegal had snapped at Irri, and Viserion had set Reznak\'s tokar ablaze the last time the seneschal had called. I have left them too much to themselves, but where am I to find the time for them? Viserion\'s tail lashed sideways, thumping the trunk of the tree so hard that a pear came tumbling down to land at Dany\'s feet. His wings unfolded, and he half flew, half hopped onto the parapet. He grows, she thought as he launched himself into the sky. They are all three growing. Soon they will be large enough to bear my weight. Then she would fly as Aegon the Conqueror had flown, up and up, until Meereen was so small that she could blot it out with her thumb. She watched Viserion climb in widening circles until he was lost to sight beyond the muddy waters of the Skahazadhan. Only then did Dany go back inside the pyramid, where Irri and Jhiqui were waiting to brush the tangles from her hair and garb her as befit the Queen of Meereen, in a Ghiscari tokar. The garment was a clumsy thing, a long loose shapeless sheet that had to be wound around her hips and under an arm and over a shoulder, its dangling fringes carefully layered and displayed. Wound too loose, it was like to fall off; wound too tight, it would tangle, trip, and bind. Even wound properly, the tokar required its wearer to hold it in place with the left hand. Walking in a tokar demanded small, mincing steps and exquisite balance, lest one tread upon those heavy trailing fringes. It was not a garment meant for any man who had to work. The tokar was a master\'s garment, a sign of wealth and power. Dany had wanted to ban the tokar when she took Meereen, but her advisors had convinced her otherwise. \"The Mother of Dragons must don the tokar or be forever hated,\" warned the Green Grace, Galazza Galare. \"In the wools of Westeros or a gown of Myrish lace, Your Radiance shall forever remain a stranger amongst us, a grotesque outlander, a barbarian conqueror. Meereen\'s queen must be a lady of Old Ghis.\" Brown Ben Plumm, the captain of the Second Sons, had put it more succinctly. \"Man wants to be the king o\' the rabbits, he best wear a pair o\' floppy ears.\" The floppy ears she chose today were made of sheer white linen, with a fringe of golden tassels. With Jhiqui\'s help, she wound the tokar about herself correctly on her third attempt. Irri fetched her crown, wrought in the shape of the three-headed dragon of her House. Its coils were gold, its wings silver, its three heads ivory, onyx, and jade. Dany\'s neck and shoulders would be stiff and sore from the weight of it before the day was done. A crown should not sit easy on the head. One of her royal forebears had said that, once. Some Aegon, but which one? Five Aegons had ruled the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. There would have been a sixth, but the Usurper\'s dogs had murdered her brother\'s son when he was still a babe at the breast. If he had lived, I might have married him. Aegon would have been closer to my age than Viserys. Dany had only been conceived when Aegon and his sister were murdered. Their father, her brother Rhaegar, perished even earlier, slain by the Usurper on the Trident. Her brother Viserys had died screaming in Vaes Dothrak with a crown of molten gold upon his head. They will kill me too if I allow it. The knives that slew my Stalwart Shield were meant for me. She had not forgotten the slave children the Great Masters had nailed up along the road from Yunkai. They had numbered one hundred sixty-three, a child every mile, nailed to mileposts with one arm outstretched to point her way. After Meereen had fallen, Dany had nailed up a like number of Great Masters. Swarms of flies had attended their slow dying, and the stench had lingered long in the plaza. Yet some days she feared that she had not gone far enough. These Meereenese were a sly and stubborn people who resisted her at every turn. They had freed their slaves, yes ... only to hire them back as servants at wages so meagre that most could scarce afford to eat. Those too old or young to be of use had been cast into the streets, along with the infirm and the crippled. And still the Great Masters gathered atop their lofty pyramids to complain of how the dragon queen had filled their noble city with hordes of unwashed beggars, thieves, and whores. To rule Meereen I must win the Meereenese, however much I may despise them. \"I am ready,\" she told Irri. Reznak and Skahaz waited atop the marble steps. \"Great queen,\" declared Reznak mo Reznak, \"you are so radiant today I fear to look on you.\" The seneschal wore a tokar of maroon silk with a golden fringe. A small, damp man, he smelled as if he had bathed in perfume and spoke a bastard form of High Valyrian, much corrupted and flavored with a thick Ghiscari growl. \"You are kind to say so,\" Dany answered, in the same tongue. \"My queen,\" growled Skahaz mo Kandaq, of the shaven head. Ghiscari hair was dense and wiry; it had long been the fashion for the men of the Slaver Cities to tease it into horns and spikes and wings. By shaving, Skahaz had put old Meereen behind him to accept the new, and his kin had done the same after his example. Others followed, though whether from fear, fashion, or ambition, Dany could not say; shavepates, they were called. Skahaz was the Shavepate ... and the vilest of traitors to the Sons of the Harpy and their ilk. \"We were told about the eunuch.\" \"His name was Stalwart Shield.\" \"More will die unless the murderers are punished.\" Even with his shaven scalp, Skahaz had an odious face-a beetled brow, small eyes with heavy bags beneath them, a big nose dark with blackheads, oily skin that looked more yellow than the usual amber of Ghiscari. It was a blunt, brutal, angry face. She could only pray it was an honest one as well. \"How can I punish them when I do not know who they are?\" Dany demanded of him. \"Tell me that, bold Skahaz.\" \"You have no lack of enemies, Your Grace. You can see their pyramids from your terrace. Zhak, Hazkar, Ghazeen, Merreq, Loraq, all the old slaving families. Pahl. Pahl, most of all. A house of women now. Bitter old women with a taste for blood. Women do not forget. Women do not forgive.\" No, Dany thought, and the Usurper\'s dogs will learn that, when I return to Westeros. It was true that there was blood between her and the House of Pahl. Oznak zo Pahl had been cut down by Strong Belwas in single combat. His father, commander of Meereen\'s city watch, had died defending the gates when Joso\'s Cock smashed them into splinters. Three uncles had been among the hundred sixty-three on the plaza. \"How much gold have we offered for information concerning the Sons of the Harpy?\" Dany asked. \"One hundred honors, if it please Your Radiance.\" \"One thousand honors would please us more. Make it so.\" \"Your Grace has not asked for my counsel,\" said Skahaz Shavepate, \"but I say that blood must pay for blood. Take one man from each of the families I have named and kill him. The next time one of yours is slain, take two from each great House and kill them both. There will not be a third murder.\" Reznak squealed in distress. \"Noooo ... gentle queen, such savagery would bring down the ire of the gods. We will find the murderers, I promise you, and when we do they will prove to be baseborn filth, you shall see.\" The seneschal was as bald as Skahaz, though in his case the gods were responsible. \"Should any hair be so insolent as to appear, my barber stands with razor ready,\" he had assured her when she raised him up. There were times when Dany wondered if that razor might not be better saved for Reznak\'s throat. He was a useful man, but she liked him little and trusted him less. The Undying of Qarth had told her she would be thrice betrayed. Mirri Maz Duur had been the first, Ser Jorah the second. Would Reznak be the third? The Shavepate? Daario? Or will it be someone I would never suspect, Ser Barristan or Grey Worm or Missandei? \"Skahaz,\" she told the Shavepate, \"I thank you for your counsel. Reznak, see what one thousand honors may accomplish.\" Clutching her tokar, Daenerys swept past them down the broad marble stair. She took one step at a time, lest she trip over her fringe and go tumbling headfirst into court. Missandei announced her. The little scribe had a sweet, strong voice. \"All kneel for Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Shackles, and Mother of Dragons.\" The hall had filled. Unsullied stood with their backs to the pillars, holding shields and spears, the spikes on their caps jutting upward like a row of knives. The Meereenese had gathered beneath the eastern windows. Her freedmen stood well apart from their former masters. Until they stand together, Meereen will know no peace. \"Arise.\" Dany settled onto her bench. The hall rose. That at least they do as one. Reznak mo Reznak had a list. Custom demanded that the queen begin with the Astapori envoy, a former slave who called himself Lord Ghael, though no one seemed to know what he was lord of. Lord Ghael had a mouth of brown and rotten teeth and the pointed yellow face of a weasel. He also had a gift. \"Cleon the Great sends these slippers as a token of his love for Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons.\" Irri slid the slippers onto Dany\'s feet. They were gilded leather, decorated with green freshwater pearls. Does the butcher king believe a pair of pretty slippers will win my hand? \"King Cleon is most generous. You may thank him for his lovely gift.\" Lovely, but made for a child. Dany had small feet, yet the pointed slippers mashed her toes together. \"Great Cleon will be pleased to know they pleased you,\" said Lord Ghael. \"His Magnificence bids me say that he stands ready to defend the Mother of Dragons from all her foes.\" If he proposes again that I wed King Cleon, I\'ll throw a slipper at his head, Dany thought, but for once the Astapori envoy made no mention of a royal marriage. Instead he said, \"The time has come for Astapor and Meereen to end the savage reign of the Wise Masters of Yunkai, who are sworn foes to all those who live in freedom. Great Cleon bids me tell you that he and his new Unsullied will soon march.\" His new Unsullied are an obscene jape. \"King Cleon would be wise to tend his own gardens and let the Yunkai\'i tend theirs.\" It was not that Dany harbored any love for Yunkai. She was coming to regret leaving the Yellow City untaken after defeating its army in the field. The Wise Masters had returned to slaving as soon as she moved on, and were busy raising levies, hiring sellswords, and making alliances against her. Cleon the self-styled Great was no better, however. The Butcher King had restored slavery to Astapor, the only change being that the former slaves were now the masters and the former masters were now the slaves. \"I am only a young girl and know little of the ways of war,\" she told Lord Ghael, \"but we have heard that Astapor is starving. Let King Cleon feed his people before he leads them out to battle.\" She made a gesture of dismissal. Ghael withdrew. \"Magnificence,\" prompted Reznak mo Reznak, \"will you hear the noble Hizdahr zo Loraq?\" Again? Dany nodded, and Hizdahr strode forth; a tall man, very slender, with flawless amber skin. He bowed on the same spot where Stalwart Shield had lain in death not long before. I need this man, Dany reminded herself. Hizdahr was a wealthy merchant with many friends in Meereen, and more across the seas. He had visited Volantis, Lys, and Qarth, had kin in Tolos and Elyria, and was even said to wield some influence in New Ghis, where the Yunkai\'i were trying to stir up enmity against Dany and her rule. And he was rich. Famously and fabulously rich ... And like to grow richer, if I grant his petition. When Dany had closed the city\'s fighting pits, the value of pit shares had plummeted. Hizdahr zo Loraq had grabbed them up with both hands, and now owned most of the fighting pits in Meereen. The nobleman had wings of wiry red-black hair sprouting from his temples. They made him look as if his head were about to take flight. His long face was made even longer by a beard bound with rings of gold. His purple tokar was fringed with amethysts and pearls. \"Your Radiance will know the reason I am here.\" \"Why, it must be because you have no other purpose but to plague me. How many times have I refused you?\" \"Five times, Your Magnificence.\" \"Six now. I will not have the fighting pits reopened.\" \"If Your Majesty will hear my arguments ...\" \"I have. Five times. Have you brought new arguments?\" \"Old arguments,\" Hizdahr admitted, \"new words. Lovely words, and courteous, more apt to move a queen.\" \"It is your cause I find wanting, not your courtesies. I have heard your arguments so often I could plead your case myself. Shall I?\" Dany leaned forward. \"The fighting pits have been a part of Meereen since the city was founded. The combats are profoundly religious in nature, a blood sacrifice to the gods of Ghis. The mortal art of Ghis is not mere butchery but a display of courage, skill, and strength most pleasing to your gods. Victorious fighters are pampered and acclaimed, and the slain are honored and remembered. By reopening the pits I would show the people of Meereen that I respect their ways and customs. The pits are far-famed across the world. They draw trade to Meereen, and fill the city\'s coffers with coin from the ends of the earth. All men share a taste for blood, a taste the pits help slake. In that way they make Meereen more tranquil. For criminals condemned to die upon the sands, the pits represent a judgment by battle, a last chance for a man to prove his innocence.\" She leaned back again, with a toss of her head. \"There. How have I done?\" \"Your Radiance has stated the case much better than I could have hoped to do myself. I see that you are eloquent as well as beautiful. I am quite persuaded.\" She had to laugh. \"Ah, but I am not.\" \"Your Magnificence,\" whispered Reznak mo Reznak in her ear, \"it is customary for the city to claim one-tenth of all the profits from the fighting pits, after expenses, as a tax. That coin might be put to many noble uses.\" \"It might ... though if we were to reopen the pits, we should take our tenth before expenses. I am only a young girl and know little of such matters, but I dwelt with Xaro Xhoan Daxos long enough to learn that much. Hizdahr, if you could marshal armies as you marshal arguments, you could conquer the world ... but my answer is still no. For the sixth time.\" \"The queen has spoken.\" He bowed again, as deeply as before. His pearls and amethysts clattered softly against the marble floor. A very limber man was Hizdahr zo Loraq. He might be handsome, but for that silly hair. Reznak and the Green Grace had been urging Dany to take a Meereenese noble for her husband, to reconcile the city to her rule. Hizdahr zo Loraq might be worth a careful look. Sooner him than Skahaz. The Shavepate had offered to set aside his wife for her, but the notion made her shudder. Hizdahr at least knew how to smile. \"Magnificence,\" said Reznak, consulting his list, \"the noble Grazdan zo Galare would address you. Will you hear him?\" \"It would be my pleasure,\" said Dany, admiring the glimmer of the gold and the sheen of the green pearls on Cleon\'s slippers while doing her best to ignore the pinching in her toes. Grazdan, she had been forewarned, was a cousin of the Green Grace, whose support she had found invaluable. The priestess was a voice for peace, acceptance, and obedience to lawful authority. I can give her cousin a respectful hearing, whatever he desires. What he desired turned out to be gold. Dany had refused to compensate any of the Great Masters for the value of their slaves, but the Meereenese kept devising other ways to squeeze coin from her. The noble Grazdan had once owned a slave woman who was a very fine weaver, it seemed; the fruits of her loom were greatly valued, not only in Meereen, but in New Ghis and Astapor and Qarth. When this woman had grown old, Grazdan had purchased half a dozen young girls and commanded the crone to instruct them in the secrets of her craft. The old woman was dead now. The young ones, freed, had opened a shop by the harbor wall to sell their weavings. Grazdan zo Galare asked that he be granted a portion of their earnings. \"They owe their skill to me,\" he insisted. \"I plucked them from the auction bloc and gave them to the loom.\" Dany listened quietly, her face still. When he was done, she said, \"What was the name of the old weaver?\" \"The slave?\" Grazdan shifted his weight, frowning. \"She was ... Elza, it might have been. Or Ella. It was six years ago she died. I have owned so many slaves, Your Grace.\" \"Let us say Elza. Here is our ruling. From the girls, you shall have nothing. It was Elza who taught them weaving, not you. From you, the girls shall have a new loom, the finest coin can buy. That is for forgetting the name of the old woman.\" Reznak would have summoned another tokar next, but Dany insisted that he call upon a freedman. Thereafter she alternated between the former masters and the former slaves. Many and more of the matters brought before her involved redress. Meereen had been sacked savagely after its fall. The stepped pyramids of the mighty had been spared the worst of the ravages, but the humbler parts of the city had been given over to an orgy of looting and killing as the city\'s slaves rose up and the starving hordes who had followed her from Yunkai and Astapor poured through the broken gates. Her Unsullied had finally restored order, but the sack left a plague of problems in its wake. And so they came to see the queen. A rich woman came, whose husband and sons had died defending the city walls. During the sack she had fled to her brother in fear. When she returned, she found her house had been turned into a brothel. The whores had bedecked themselves in her jewels and clothes. She wanted her house back, and her jewels. \"They can keep the clothes,\" she allowed. Dany granted her the jewels but ruled the house was lost when she abandoned it. A former slave came, to accuse a certain noble of the Zhak. The man had recently taken to wife a freedwoman who had been the noble\'s bed-warmer before the city fell. The noble had taken her maidenhood, used her for his pleasure, and gotten her with child. Her new husband wanted the noble gelded for the crime of rape, and he wanted a purse of gold as well, to pay him for raising the noble\'s bastard as his own. Dany granted him the gold, but not the gelding. \"When he lay with her, your wife was his property, to do with as he would. By law, there was no rape.\" Her decision did not please him, she could see, but if she gelded every man who ever forced a bedslave, she would soon rule a city of eunuchs. A boy came, younger than Dany, slight and scarred, dressed up in a frayed grey tokar trailing silver fringe. His voice broke when he told of how two of his father\'s household slaves had risen up the night the gate broke. One had slain his father, the other his elder brother. Both had raped his mother before killing her as well. The boy had escaped with no more than the scar upon his face, but one of the murderers was still living in his father\'s house, and the other had joined the queen\'s soldiers as one of the Mother\'s Men. He wanted them both hanged. I am queen over a city built on dust and death. Dany had no choice but to deny him. She had declared a blanket pardon for all crimes committed during the sack. Nor would she punish slaves for rising up against their masters. When she told him, the boy rushed at her, but his feet tangled in his tokar and he went sprawling headlong on the purple marble. Strong Belwas was on him at once. The huge brown eunuch yanked him up one-handed and shook him like a mastiff with a rat. \"Enough, Belwas,\" Dany called. \"Release him.\" To the boy she said, \"Treasure that tokar, for it saved your life. You are only a boy, so we will forget what happened here. You should do the same.\" But as he left the boy looked back over his shoulder, and when she saw his eyes Dany thought, The Harpy has another Son. By midday Daenerys was feeling the weight of the crown upon her head, and the hardness of the bench beneath her. With so many still waiting on her pleasure, she did not stop to eat. Instead she dispatched Jhiqui to the kitchens for a platter of flatbread, olives, figs, and cheese. She nibbled whilst she listened, and sipped from a cup of watered wine. The figs were fine, the olives even finer, but the wine left a tart metallic aftertaste in her mouth. The small pale yellow grapes native to these regions produced a notably inferior vintage. We shall have no trade in wine. Besides, the Great Masters had burned the best arbors along with the olive trees. In the afternoon a sculptor came, proposing to replace the head of the great bronze harpy in the Plaza of Purification with one cast in Dany\'s image. She denied him with as much courtesy as she could muster. A pike of unprecedented size had been caught in the Skahazadhan, and the fisherman wished to give it to the queen. She admired the fish extravagantly, rewarded the fisherman with a purse of silver, and sent the pike to her kitchens. A coppersmith had fashioned her a suit of burnished rings to wear to war. She accepted it with fulsome thanks; it was lovely to behold, and all that burnished copper would flash prettily in the sun, though if actual battle threatened, she would sooner be clad in steel. Even a young girl who knew nothing of the ways of war knew that. The slippers the Butcher King had sent her had grown too uncomfortable. Dany kicked them off and sat with one foot tucked beneath her and the other swinging back and forth. It was not a very regal pose, but she was tired of being regal. The crown had given her a headache, and her buttocks had gone to sleep. \"Ser Barristan,\" she called, \"I know what quality a king needs most.\" \"Courage, Your Grace?\" \"Cheeks like iron,\" she teased. \"All I do is sit.\" \"Your Grace takes too much on herself. You should allow your councillors to shoulder more of your burdens.\" \"I have too many councillors and too few cushions.\" Dany turned to Reznak. \"How many more?\" \" Three-and-twenty, if it please Your Magnificence. With as many claims.\" The seneschal consulted some papers. \"One calf and three goats. The rest will be sheep or lambs, no doubt.\" \" Three-and-twenty.\" Dany sighed. \"My dragons have developed a prodigious taste for mutton since we began to pay the shepherds for their kills. Have these claims been proven?\" \"Some men have brought burnt bones.\" \"Men make fires. Men cook mutton. Burnt bones prove nothing. Brown Ben says there are red wolves in the hills outside the city, and jack-als and wild dogs. Must we pay good silver for every lamb that goes astray between Yunkai and the Skahazadhan?\" \"No, Magnificence.\" Reznak bowed. \"Shall I send these rascals away, or will you want them scourged?\" Daenerys shifted on the bench. \"No man should ever fear to come to me.\" Some claims were false, she did not doubt, but more were genuine. Her dragons had grown too large to be content with rats and cats and dogs. The more they eat, the larger they will grow, Ser Barristan had warned her, and the larger they grow, the more they\'ll eat. Drogon especially ranged far afield and could easily devour a sheep a day. \"Pay them for the value of their animals,\" she told Reznak, \"but henceforth claimants must present themselves at the Temple of the Graces and swear a holy oath before the gods of Ghis.\" \"It shall be done.\" Reznak turned to the petitioners. \"Her Magnificence the Queen has consented to compensate each of you for the animals you have lost,\" he told them in the Ghiscari tongue. \"Present yourselves to my factors on the morrow, and you shall be paid in coin or kind, as you prefer.\" The pronouncement was received in sullen silence. You would think they might be happier, Dany thought. They have what they came for. Is there no way to please these people? One man lingered behind as the rest were filing out-a squat man with a windburnt face, shabbily dressed. His hair was a cap of coarse red-black wire cropped about his ears, and in one hand he held a sad cloth sack. He stood with his head down, gazing at the marble floor as if he had quite forgotten where he was. And what does this one want? Dany wondered. \"All kneel for Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Shackles, and Mother of Dragons,\" cried Missandei in her high, sweet voice. As Dany stood, her tokar began to slip. She caught it and tugged it back in place. \"You with the sack,\" she called, \"did you wish to speak with us? You may approach.\" When he raised his head, his eyes were red and raw as open sores. Dany glimpsed Ser Barristan sliding closer, a white shadow at her side. The man approached in a stumbling shuffle, one step and then another, clutching his sack. Is he drunk, or ill? she wondered. There was dirt beneath his cracked yellow fingernails. \"What is it?\" Dany asked. \"Do you have some grievance to lay before us, some petition? What would you have of us?\" His tongue flicked nervously over chapped, cracked lips. \"I ... I brought ...\" \"Bones?\" she said, impatiently. \"Burnt bones?\" He lifted the sack, and spilled its contents on the marble. Bones they were, broken bones and blackened. The longer ones had been cracked open for their marrow. \"It were the black one,\" the man said, in a Ghiscari growl, \"the winged shadow. He come down from the sky and ... and ...\" No. Dany shivered. No, no, oh no. \"Are you deaf, fool?\" Reznak mo Reznak demanded of the man. \"Did you not hear my pronouncement? See my factors on the morrow, and you shall be paid for your sheep.\" \"Reznak,\" Ser Barristan said quietly, \"hold your tongue and open your eyes. Those are no sheep bones.\" No, Dany thought, those are the bones of a child.');

INSERT INTO `books` VALUES ('ASOIAF','AFFC',2,'The Captain of Guards','Areo Hotah',' The blood oranges are well past ripe,\" the prince observed in a weary voice, when the captain rolled him onto the terrace. After that he did not speak again for hours. It was true about the oranges. A few had fallen to burst open on the pale pink marble. The sharp sweet smell of them filled Hotah\'s nostrils each time he took a breath. No doubt the prince could smell them too, as he sat beneath the trees in the rolling chair Maester Caleotte had made for him, with its goose-down cushions and rumbling wheels of ebony and iron. For a long while the only sounds were the children splashing in the pools and fountains, and once a soft plop as another orange dropped onto the terrace to burst. Then, from the far side of the palace, the captain heard the faint drumbeat of boots on marble. Obara. He knew her stride; long-legged, hasty, angry. In the stables by the gates, her horse would be lathered, and bloody from her spurs. She always rode stallions, and had been heard to boast that she could master any horse in Dorne... and any man as well. The captain could hear other footsteps as well, the quick soft scuffing of Maester Caleotte hurrying to keep up. Obara Sand always walked too fast. She is chasing after something she can never catch, the prince had told his daughter once, in the captain\'s hearing. When she appeared beneath the triple arch, Areo Hotah swung his longaxe sideways to block the way. The head was on a shaft of mountain ash six feet long, so she could not go around. \"My lady, no farther.\" His voice was a bass grumble thick with the accents of Norvos. \"The prince does not wish to be disturbed.\" Her face had been stone before he spoke; then it hardened. \"You are in my way, Hotah.\" Obara was the eldest Sand Snake, a big-boned woman near to thirty, with the close-set eyes and rat-brown hair of the Oldtown whore who\'d birthed her. Beneath a mottled sandsilk cloak of dun and gold, her riding clothes were old brown leather, worn and supple. They were the softest things about her. On one hip she wore a coiled whip, across her back a round shield of steel and copper. She had left her spear outside. For that, Areo Hotah gave thanks. Quick and strong as she was, the woman was no match for him, he knew... but she did not, and he had no wish to see her blood upon the pale pink marble. Maester Caleotte shifted his weight from foot to foot. \"Lady Obara, I tried to tell you...\" \"Does he know that my father is dead?\" Obara asked the captain, paying the maester no more mind than she would a fly, if any fly had been foolish enough to buzz about her head. \"He does,\" the captain said. \"He had a bird.\" Death had come to Dorne on raven wings, writ small and sealed with a blob of hard red wax. Caleotte must have sensed what was in that letter, for he\'d given it Hotah to deliver. The prince thanked him, but for the longest time he would not break the seal. All afternoon he\'d sat with the parchment in his lap, watching the children at their play. He watched until the sun went down and the evening air grew cool enough to drive them inside; then he watched the starlight on the water. It was moonrise before he sent Hotah to fetch a candle, so he might read his letter beneath the orange trees in the dark of night. Obara touched her whip. \"Thousands are crossing the sands afoot to climb the Boneway, so they may help Ellaria bring my father home. The septs are packed to bursting, and the red priests have lit their temple fires. In the pillow houses women are coupling with every man who comes to them, and refusing any coin. In Sunspear, on the Broken Arm, along the Greenblood, in the mountains, out in the deep sand, everywhere, everywhere, women tear their hair and men cry out in rage. The same question is heard on every tongue-what will Doran do? What will his brother do to avenge our murdered prince?\" She moved closer to the captain. \"And you say, he does not wish to be disturbed!\" \"He does not wish to be disturbed,\" Areo Hotah said again. The captain of guards knew the prince he guarded. Once, long ago, a callow youth had come from Norvos, a big broad-shouldered boy with a mop of dark hair. That hair was white now, and his body bore the scars of many battles... but his strength remained, and he kept his longaxe sharp, as the bearded priests had taught him. She shall not pass, he told himself, and said, \"The prince is watching the children at their play. He is never to be disturbed when he is watching the children at their play.\" \"Hotah,\" said Obara Sand, \"you will remove yourself from my path, else I shall take that longaxe and-\" \"Captain,\" came the command, from behind. \"Let her pass. I will speak with her.\" The prince\'s voice was hoarse. Areo Hotah jerked his longaxe upright and stepped to one side. Obara gave him a lingering last look and strode past, the maester hurrying at her heels. Caleotte was no more than five feet tall and bald as an egg. His face was so smooth and fat that it was hard to tell his age, but he had been here before the captain, had even served the prince\'s mother. Despite his age and girth, he was still nimble enough, and clever as they came, but meek. He is no match for any Sand Snake, the captain thought. In the shade of the orange trees, the prince sat in his chair with his gouty legs propped up before him, and heavy bags beneath his eyes... though whether it was grief or gout that kept him sleepless, Hotah could not say. Below, in the fountains and the pools, the children were still at their play. The youngest were no more than five, the oldest nine and ten. Half were girls and half were boys. Hotah could hear them splashing and shouting at each other in high, shrill voices. \"It was not so long ago that you were one of the children in those pools, Obara,\" the prince said, when she took one knee before his rolling chair. She snorted. \"It has been twenty years, or near enough to make no matter. And I was not here long. I am the whore\'s whelp, or had you forgotten?\" When he did not answer, she rose again and put her hands upon her hips. \"My father has been murdered.\" \"He was slain in single combat during a trial by battle,\" Prince Doran said. \"By law, that is no murder.\" \"He was your brother.\" \"He was.\" \"What do you mean to do about his death?\" The prince turned his chair laboriously to face her. Though he was but two-and-fifty, Doran Martell seemed much older. His body was soft and shapeless beneath his linen robes, and his legs were hard to look upon. The gout had swollen and reddened his joints grotesquely; his left knee was an apple, his right a melon, and his toes had turned to dark red grapes, so ripe it seemed as though a touch would burst them. Even the weight of a coverlet could make him shudder, though he bore the pain without complaint. Silence is a prince\'s friend, the captain had heard him tell his daughter once. Words are like arrows, Arianne. Once loosed, you cannot call them back. \"I have written to Lord Tywin-\" \"Written? If you were half the man my father was-\" \"I am not your father.\" \"That I knew.\" Obara\'s voice was thick with contempt. \"You would have me go to war.\" \"I know better. You need not even leave your chair. Let me avenge my father. You have a host in the Prince\'s Pass. Lord Yronwood has another in the Boneway. Grant me the one and Nym the other. Let her ride the kingsroad, whilst I turn the marcher lords out of their castles and hook round to march on Oldtown.\" \"And how could you hope to hold Oldtown?\" \"It will be enough to sack it. The wealth of Hightower-\" \"Is it gold you want?\" \"It is blood I want.\" \"Lord Tywin shall deliver us the Mountain\'s head.\" \"And who will deliver us Lord Tywin\'s head? The Mountain has always been his pet.\" The prince gestured toward the pools. \"Obara, look at the children, if it please you.\" \"It does not please me. I\'d get more pleasure from driving my spear into Lord Tywin\'s belly. I\'ll make him sing \'The Rains of Castamere\' as I pull his bowels out and look for gold.\" \"Look,\" the prince repeated. \"I command you.\" A few of the older children lay facedown upon the smooth pink marble, browning in the sun. Others paddled in the sea beyond. Three were building a sand castle with a great spike that resembled the Spear Tower of the Old Palace. A score or more had gathered in the big pool, to watch the battles as smaller children rode through the waist-deep shallows on the shoulders of the larger and tried to shove each other into the water. Every time a pair went down, the splash was followed by a roar of laughter. They watched a nut-brown girl yank a towheaded boy off his brother\'s shoulders to tumble him headfirst into the pool. \"Your father played that same game once, as I did before him,\" said the prince. \"We had ten years between us, so I had left the pools by the time he was old enough to play, but I would watch him when I came to visit Mother. He was so fierce, even as a boy. Quick as a water snake. I oft saw him topple boys much bigger than himself. He reminded me of that the day he left for King\'s Landing. He swore that he would do it one more time, else I would never have let him go.\" \"Let him go?\" Obara laughed. \"As if you could have stopped him. The Red Viper of Dorne went where he would.\" \"He did. I wish I had some word of comfort to-\" \"I did not come to you for comfort.\" Her voice was full of scorn. \"The day my father came to claim me, my mother did not wish for me to go. \'She is a girl,\' she said, \'and I do not think that she is yours. I had a thousand other men.\' He tossed his spear at my feet and gave my mother the back of his hand across the face, so she began to weep. \'Girl or boy, we fight our battles,\' he said, \'but the gods let us choose our weapons.\' He pointed to the spear, then to my mother\'s tears, and I picked up the spear. \'I told you she was mine,\' my father said, and took me. My mother drank herself to death within the year. They say that she was weeping as she died.\" Obara edged closer to the prince in his chair. \"Let me use the spear; I ask no more.\" \"It is a deal to ask, Obara. I shall sleep on it.\" \"You have slept too long already.\" \"You may be right. I will send word to you at Sunspear.\" \"So long as the word is war.\" Obara turned upon her heel and strode off as angrily as she had come, back to the stables for a fresh horse and another headlong gallop down the road. Maester Caleotte remained behind. \"My prince?\" the little round man asked. \"Do your legs hurt?\" The prince smiled faintly. \"Is the sun hot?\" \"Shall I fetch a draught for the pain?\" \"No. I need my wits about me.\" The maester hesitated. \"My prince, is it... is it prudent to allow Lady Obara to return to Sunspear? She is certain to inflame the common people. They loved your brother well.\" \"So did we all.\" He pressed his fingers to his temples. \"No. You are right. I must return to Sunspear as well.\" The little round man hesitated. \"Is that wise?\" \"Not wise, but necessary. Best send a rider to Ricasso, and have him open my apartments in the Tower of the Sun. Inform my daughter Arianne that I will be there on the morrow.\" My little princess. The captain had missed her sorely. \"You will be seen,\" the maester warned. The captain understood. Two years ago, when they had left Sunspear for the peace and isolation of the Water Gardens, Prince Doran\'s gout had not been half so bad. In those days he had still walked, albeit slowly, leaning on a stick and grimacing with every step. The prince did not wish his enemies to know how feeble he had grown, and the Old Palace and its shadow city were full of eyes. Eyes, the captain thought, and steps he cannot climb. He would need to fly to sit atop the Tower of the Sun. \"I must be seen. Someone must pour oil on the waters. Dorne must be reminded that it still has a prince.\" He smiled wanly. \"Old and gouty though he is.\" \"If you return to Sunspear, you will need to give audience to Princess Myrcella,\" Caleotte said. \"Her white knight will be with her... and you know he sends letters to his queen.\" \"I suppose he does.\" The white knight. The captain frowned. Ser Arys had come to Dorne to attend his own princess, as Areo Hotah had once come with his. Even their names sounded oddly alike: Areo and Arys. Yet there the likeness ended. The captain had left Norvos and its bearded priests, but Ser Arys Oakheart still served the Iron Throne. Hotah had felt a certain sadness whenever he saw the man in the long snowy cloak, the times the prince had sent him down to Sunspear. One day, he sensed, the two of them would fight; on that day Oakheart would die, with the captain\'s longaxe crashing through his skull. He slid his hand along the smooth ashen shaft of his axe and wondered if that day was drawing nigh. \"The afternoon is almost done,\" the prince was saying. \"We will wait for morn. See that my litter is ready by first light.\" \"As you command.\" Caleotte bobbed a bow. The captain stood aside to let him pass, and listened to his footsteps dwindle. \"Captain?\" The prince\'s voice was soft. Hotah strode forward, one hand wrapped about his longaxe. The ash felt as smooth as a woman\'s skin against his palm. When he reached the rolling chair he thumped its butt down hard to announce his presence, but the prince had eyes only for the children. \"Did you have brothers, captain?\" he asked. \"Back in Norvos, when you were young? Sisters?\" \"Both,\" Hotah said. \"Two brothers, three sisters. I was the youngest.\" The youngest, and unwanted. Another mouth to feed, a big boy who ate too much and soon outgrew his clothes. Small wonder they had sold him to the bearded priests. \"I was the oldest,\" the prince said, \"and yet I am the last. After Mors and Olyvar died in their cradles, I gave up hope of brothers. I was nine when Elia came, a squire in service at Salt Shore. When the raven arrived with word that my mother had been brought to bed a month too soon, I was old enough to understand that meant the child would not live. Even when Lord Gargalen told me that I had a sister, I assured him that she must shortly die. Yet she lived, by the Mother\'s mercy. And a year later Oberyn arrived, squalling and kicking. I was a man grown when they were playing in these pools. Yet here I sit, and they are gone.\" Areo Hotah did not know what to say to that. He was only a captain of guards, and still a stranger to this land and its seven-faced god, even after all these years. Serve. Obey. Protect. He had sworn those vows at six-and-ten, the day he wed his axe. Simple vows for simple men, the bearded priests had said. He had not been trained to counsel grieving princes. He was still groping for some words to say when another orange fell with a heavy splat, no more than a foot from where the prince was seated. Doran winced at the sound, as if somehow it had hurt him. \"Enough,\" he sighed, \"it is enough. Leave me, Areo. Let me watch the children for a few more hours.\" When the sun set the air grew cool and the children went inside in search of supper, still the prince remained beneath his orange trees, looking out over the still pools and the sea beyond. A serving man brought him a bowl of purple olives, with flatbread, cheese, and chickpea paste. He ate a bit of it, and drank a cup of the sweet, heavy strongwine that he loved. When it was empty, he filled it once again. Sometimes in the deep black hours of the morning sleep found him in his chair. Only then did the captain roll him down the moonlit gallery, past a row of fluted pillars and through a graceful archway, to a great bed with crisp cool linen sheets in a chamber by the sea. Doran groaned as the captain moved him, but the gods were good and he did not wake. The captain\'s sleeping cell adjoined his prince\'s. He sat upon the narrow bed and found his whetstone and oilcloth in their niche, and set to work. Keep your longaxe sharp, the bearded priests had told him, the day they branded him. He always did. As he honed the axe, Hotah thought of Norvos, the high city on the hill and the low beside the river. He could still recall the sounds of the three bells, the way that Noom\'s deep peals set his very bones to shuddering, the proud strong voice of Narrah, sweet Nyel\'s silvery laughter. The taste of wintercake filled his mouth again, rich with ginger and pine nuts and bits of cherry, with nahsa to wash it down, fermented goat\'s milk served in an iron cup and laced with honey. He saw his mother in her dress with the squirrel collar, the one she wore but once each year, when they went to see the bears dance down the Sinner\'s Steps. And he smelled the stench of burning hair as the bearded priest touched the brand to the center of his chest. The pain had been so fierce that he thought his heart might stop, yet Areo Hotah had not flinched. The hair had never grown back over the axe. Only when both edges were sharp enough to shave with did the captain lay his ash-and-iron wife down on the bed. Yawning, he pulled off his soiled clothes, tossed them on the floor, and stretched out on his straw-stuffed mattress. Thinking of the brand had made it itch, so he had to scratch himself before he closed his eyes. I should have gathered up the oranges that fell, he thought, and went to sleep dreaming of the tart sweet taste of them, and the sticky feel of the red juice on his fingers. Dawn came too soon. Outside the stables the smallest of the three horse litters stood ready, the cedarwood litter with the red silk draperies. The captain chose twenty spears to accompany it, out of the thirty who were posted at the Water Gardens; the rest would stay to guard the grounds and children, some of whom were the sons and daughters of great lords and wealthy merchants. Although the prince had spoken of departing at first light, Areo Hotah knew that he would dawdle. Whilst the maester helped Doran Martell to bathe and bandaged up his swollen joints in linen wraps soaked with soothing lotions, the captain donned a shirt of copper scales as befit his rank, and a billowing cloak of dun-and-yellow sandsilk to keep the sun off the copper. The day promised to be hot, and the captain had long ago discarded the heavy horsehair cape and studded leather tunic he had worn in Norvos, which were like to cook a man in Dorne. He had kept his iron halfhelm, with its crest of sharpened spikes, but now he wore it wrapped in orange silk, weaving the cloth in and around the spikes. Elsewise the sun beating down on the metal would have his head pounding before they saw the palace. The prince was still not ready to depart. He had decided to break his fast before he went, with a blood orange and a plate of gull\'s eggs diced with bits of ham and fiery peppers. Then nought would do but he must say farewell to several of the children who had become especial favorites: the Dalt boy and Lady Blackmont\'s brood and the round-faced orphan girl whose father had sold cloth and spices up and down the Greenblood. Doran kept a splendid Myrish blanket over his legs as he spoke with them, to spare the young ones the sight of his swollen, bandaged joints. It was midday before they got under way; the prince in his litter, Maester Caleotte riding on a donkey, the rest afoot. Five spearmen walked ahead and five behind, with five more flanking the litter to either side. Areo Hotah himself took his familiar place at the left hand of the prince, resting his longaxe on a shoulder as he walked. The road from Sunspear to the Water Gardens ran beside the sea, so they had a cool fresh breeze to soothe them as they made their way across a sparse red-brown land of stone and sand and twisted stunted trees. Halfway there, the second Sand Snake caught them. She appeared suddenly upon a dune, mounted on a golden sand steed with a mane like fine white silk. Even ahorse, the Lady Nym looked graceful, dressed all in shimmering lilac robes and a great silk cape of cream and copper that lifted at every gust of wind, and made her look as if she might take flight. Nymeria Sand was five-and-twenty, and slender as a willow. Her straight black hair, worn in a long braid bound up with red-gold wire, made a widow\'s peak above her dark eyes, just as her father\'s had. With her high cheekbones, full lips, and milk-pale skin, she had all the beauty that her elder sister lacked... but Obara\'s mother had been an Oldtown whore, whilst Nym was born from the noblest blood of old Volantis. A dozen mounted spearmen tailed her, their round shields gleaming in the sun. They followed her down the dune. The prince had tied back the curtains on his litter, the better to enjoy the breeze blowing off the sea. Lady Nym fell in beside him, slowing her pretty golden mare to match the litter\'s pace. \"Well met, Uncle,\" she sang out, as if it had been chance that brought her here. \"May I ride with you to Sunspear?\" The captain was on the opposite side of the litter from Lady Nym, yet he could hear every word she said. \"I would be glad of it,\" Prince Doran replied, though he did not sound glad to the captain\'s ears. \"Gout and grief make poor companions on the road.\" By which the captain knew him to mean that every pebble drove a spike through his swollen joints. \"The gout I cannot help,\" she said, \"but my father had no use for grief. Vengeance was more to his taste. Is it true that Gregor Clegane admitted slaying Elia and her children?\" \"He roared out his guilt for all the court to hear,\" the prince admitted. \"Lord Tywin has promised us his head.\" \"And a Lannister always pays his debts,\" said Lady Nym, \"yet it seems to me that Lord Tywin means to pay us with our own coin. I had a bird from our sweet Ser Daemon, who swears my father tickled that monster more than once as they fought. If so, Ser Gregor is as good as dead, and no thanks to Tywin Lannister.\" The prince grimaced. Whether it was from the pain of gout or his niece\'s words, the captain could not say. \"It may be so.\" \"May be? I say \'tis.\" \"Obara would have me go to war.\" Nym laughed. \"Yes, she wants to set the torch to Oldtown. She hates that city as much as our little sister loves it.\" \"And you?\" Nym glanced over a shoulder, to where her companions rode a dozen lengths behind. \"I was abed with the Fowler twins when the word reached me,\" the captain heard her say. \"You know the Fowler words? Let Me Soar! That is all I ask of you. Let me soar, Uncle. I need no mighty host, only one sweet sister.\" \"Obara?\" \"Tyene. Obara is too loud. Tyene is so sweet and gentle that no man will suspect her. Obara would make Oldtown our father\'s funeral pyre, but I am not so greedy. Four lives will suffice for me. Lord Tywin\'s golden twins, as payment for Elia\'s children. The old lion, for Elia herself. And last of all the little king, for my father.\" \"The boy has never wronged us.\" \"The boy is a bastard born of treason, incest, and adultery, if Lord Stannis can be believed.\" The playful tone had vanished from her voice, and the captain found himself watching her through narrowed eyes. Her sister Obara wore her whip upon her hip and carried a spear where any man could see it. Lady Nym was no less deadly, though she kept her knives well hidden. \"Only royal blood can wash out my father\'s murder.\" \"Oberyn died during single combat, fighting in a matter that was none of his concern. I do not call that murder.\" \"Call it what you will. We sent them the finest man in Dorne, and they are sending back a bag of bones.\" \"He went beyond anything I asked of him. \'Take the measure of this boy king and his council, and make note of their strengths and weaknesses,\' I told him, on the terrace. We were eating oranges. \'Find us friends, if there are any to be found. Learn what you can of Elia\'s end, but see that you do not provoke Lord Tywin unduly,\' those were my words to him. Oberyn laughed, and said, \'When have I provoked any man... unduly? You would do better to warn the Lannisters against provoking me.\' He wanted justice for Elia, but he would not wait-\" \"He waited ten-and-seven years,\" the Lady Nym broke in. \"Were it you they\'d killed, my father would have led his banners north before your corpse was cold. Were it you, the spears would be falling thick as rain upon the marches now.\" \"I do not doubt it.\" \"No more should you doubt this, my prince-my sisters and I shall not wait ten-and-seven years for our vengeance.\" She put her spurs into the mare and she was off, galloping toward Sunspear with her tail in hot pursuit. The prince leaned back against his pillows and closed his eyes, but Hotah knew he did not sleep. He is in pain. For a moment he considered calling Maester Caleotte up to the litter, but if Prince Doran had wanted him, he would have called himself. The shadows of the afternoon were long and dark and the sun was as red and swollen as the prince\'s joints before they glimpsed the towers of Sunspear to the east. First the slender Spear Tower, a hundred-and-a-half feet tall and crowned with a spear of gilded steel that added another thirty feet to its height; then the mighty Tower of the Sun, with its dome of gold and leaded glass; last the dun-colored Sandship, looking like some monstrous dromond that had washed ashore and turned to stone. Only three leagues of coast road divided Sunspear from the Water Gardens, yet they were two different worlds. There children frolicked naked in the sun, music played in tiled courtyards, and the air was sharp with the smell of lemons and blood oranges. Here the air smelled of dust, sweat, and smoke, and the nights were alive with the babble of voices. In place of the pink marble of the Water Gardens, Sunspear was built from mud and straw, and colored brown and dun. The ancient stronghold of House Martell stood at the easternmost end of a little jut of stone and sand, surrounded on three sides by the sea. To the west, in the shadows of Sunspear\'s massive walls, mud-brick shops and windowless hovels clung to the castle like barnacles to a galley\'s hull. Stables and inns and winesinks and pillow houses had grown up west of those, many enclosed by walls of their own, and yet more hovels had risen beneath those walls. And so and so and so, as the bearded priests would say. Compared to Tyrosh or Myr or Great Norvos, the shadow city was no more than a town, yet it was the nearest thing to a true city that these Dornish had. Lady Nym\'s arrival had preceded theirs by some hours, and no doubt she had warned the guards of their coming, for the Threefold Gate was open when they reached it. Only here were the gates lined up one behind the other to allow visitors to pass beneath all three of the Winding Walls directly to the Old Palace, without first making their way through miles of narrow alleys, hidden courts, and noisy bazaars. Prince Doran had closed the draperies of his litter as soon as the Spear Tower came in sight, yet still the smallfolk shouted out to him as the litter passed. The Sand Snakes have stirred them to a boil, the captain thought uneasily. They crossed the squalor of the outer crescent and went through the second gate. Beyond, the wind stank of tar and salt water and rotting seaweed, and the crowd grew thicker with every step. \"Make way for Prince Doran!\" Areo Hotah boomed out, thumping the butt of his longaxe on the bricks. \"Make way for the Prince of Dorne!\" \"The prince is dead!\" a woman shrilled behind him. \"To spears!\" a man bellowed from a balcony. \"Doran!\" called some highborn voice. \"To the spears!\" Hotah gave up looking for the speakers; the press was too thick, and a third of them were shouting. \"To spears! Vengeance for the Viper!\" By the time they reached the third gate, the guards were shoving people aside to clear a path for the prince\'s litter, and the crowd was throwing things. One ragged boy darted past the spearmen with a half-rotten pomegranate in one hand, but when he saw Areo Hotah in his path, with longaxe at the ready, he let the fruit fall unthrown and beat a quick retreat. Others farther back let fly with lemons, limes, and oranges, crying \"War! War! To the spears!\" One of the guards was hit in the eye with a lemon, and the captain himself had an orange splatter off his foot. No answer came from within the litter. Doran Martell stayed cloaked within his silken walls until the thicker walls of the castle swallowed all of them, and the portcullis came down behind them with a rattling crunch. The sounds of shouting dwindled away slowly. Princess Arianne was waiting in the outer ward to greet her father, with half the court about her: the old blind seneschal Ricasso, Ser Manfrey Martell the castellan, young Maester Myles with his grey robes and silky perfumed beard, twoscore of Dornish knights in flowing linen of half a hundred hues. Little Myrcella Baratheon stood with her septa and Ser Arys of the Kingsguard, sweltering in his white-enameled scales. Princess Arianne strode to the litter on snakeskin sandals laced up to her thighs. Her hair was a mane of jet-black ringlets that fell to the small of her back, and around her brow was a band of copper suns. She is still a little thing, the captain thought. Where the Sand Snakes were tall, Arianne took after her mother, who stood but five foot two. Yet beneath her jeweled girdle and loose layers of flowing purple silk and yellow samite she had a woman\'s body, lush and roundly curved. \"Father,\" she announced as the curtains opened, \"Sunspear rejoices at your return.\" \"Yes, I heard the joy.\" The prince smiled wanly and cupped his daughter\'s cheek with a reddened, swollen hand. \"You look well. Captain, be so good as to help me down from here.\" Hotah slid his longaxe into its sling across his back and gathered the prince into his arms, tenderly so as not to jar his swollen joints. Even so, Doran Martell bit back a gasp of pain. \"I have commanded the cooks to prepare a feast for this evening,\" Arianne said, \"with all your favorite dishes.\" \"I fear I could not do them justice.\" The prince glanced slowly around the yard. \"I do not see Tyene.\" \"She begs a private word. I sent her to the throne room to await your coming.\" The prince sighed. \"Very well. Captain? The sooner I am done with this, the sooner I may rest.\" Hotah bore him up the long stone steps of the Tower of the Sun, to the great round chamber beneath the dome, where the last light of the afternoon was slanting down through thick windows of many-colored glass to dapple the pale marble with diamonds of half a hundred colors. There the third Sand Snake awaited them. She was sitting cross-legged on a pillow beneath the raised dais where the high seats stood, but she rose as they entered, dressed in a clinging gown of pale blue samite with sleeves of Myrish lace that made her look as innocent as the Maid herself. In one hand was a piece of embroidery she had been working on, in the other a pair of golden needles. Her hair was gold as well, and her eyes were deep blue pools... and yet somehow they reminded the captain of her father\'s eyes, though Oberyn\'s had been as black as night. All of Prince Oberyn\'s daughters have his viper eyes, Hotah realized suddenly. The color does not matter. \"Uncle,\" said Tyene Sand, \"I have been waiting for you.\" \"Captain, help me to the high seat.\" There were two seats on the dais, near twin to one another, save that one had the Martell spear inlaid in gold upon its back, whilst the other bore the blazing Rhoynish sun that had flown from the masts of Nymeria\'s ships when first they came to Dorne. The captain placed the prince beneath the spear and stepped away. \"Does it hurt so much?\" Lady Tyene\'s voice was gentle, and she looked as sweet as summer strawberries. Her mother had been a septa, and Tyene had an air of almost otherworldy innocence about her. \"Is there aught that I might do to ease your pain?\" \"Say what you would and let me rest. I am weary, Tyene.\" \"I made this for you, Uncle.\" Tyene unfolded the piece she\'d been embroidering. It showed her father, Prince Oberyn, mounted on a sand steed and armored all in red, smiling. \"When I finish, it is yours, to help you remember him.\" \"I am not like to forget your father.\" \"That is good to know. Many have wondered.\" \"Lord Tywin has promised us the Mountain\'s head.\" \"He is so kind... but a headsman\'s sword is no fit end for brave Ser Gregor. We have prayed so long for his death, it is only fair that he pray for it as well. I know the poison that my father used, and there is none slower or more agonizing. Soon we may hear the Mountain screaming, even here in Sunspear.\" Prince Doran sighed. \"Obara cries to me for war. Nym will be content with murder. And you?\" \"War,\" said Tyene, \"though not my sister\'s war. Dornishmen fight best at home, so I say let us hone our spears and wait. When the Lannisters and the Tyrells come down on us, we shall bleed them in the passes and bury them beneath the blowing sands, as we have a hundred times before.\" \"If they should come down on us.\" \"Oh, but they must, or see the realm riven once more, as it was before we wed the dragons. Father told me so. He said we had the Imp to thank, for sending us Princess Myrcella. She is so pretty, don\'t you think? I wish that I had curls like hers. She was made to be a queen, just like her mother.\" Dimples bloomed in Tyene\'s cheeks. \"I would be honored to arrange the wedding, and to see to the making of the crowns as well. Trystane and Myrcella are so innocent, I thought perhaps white gold... with emeralds, to match Myrcella\'s eyes. Oh, diamonds and pearls would serve as well, so long as the children are wed and crowned. Then we need only hail Myrcella as the First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and lawful heir to the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and wait for the lions to come.\" \"The lawful heir?\" The prince snorted. \"She is older than her brother,\" explained Tyene, as if he were some fool. \"By law the Iron Throne should pass to her.\" \"By Dornish law.\" \"When good King Daeron wed Princess Myriah and brought us into his kingdom, it was agreed that Dornish law would always rule in Dorne. And Myrcella is in Dorne, as it happens.\" \"So she is.\" His tone was grudging. \"Let me think on it.\" Tyene grew cross. \"You think too much, Uncle.\" \"Do I?\" \"Father said so.\" \"Oberyn thought too little.\" \"Some men think because they are afraid to do.\" \"There is a difference between fear and caution.\" \"Oh, I must pray that I never see you frightened, Uncle. You might forget to breathe.\" She raised a hand... The captain brought the butt of his longaxe down upon the marble with a thump. \"My lady, you presume. Step from the dais, if it please you.\" \"I meant no harm, Captain. I love my uncle, as I know he loved my father.\" Tyene went to one knee before the prince. \"I have said all I came to say, Uncle. Forgive me if I gave offense; my heart is broken all to pieces. Do I still have your love?\" \"Always.\" \"Give me your blessing, then, and I shall go.\" Doran hesitated half a heartbeat before placing his hand on his niece\'s head. \"Be brave, child.\" \"Oh, how not? I am his daughter.\" No sooner had she taken her leave than Maester Caleotte hurried to the dais. \"My prince, she did not... here, let me see your hand.\" He examined the palm first, then gently turned it upside down to sniff at the back of the prince\'s fingers. \"No, good. That is good. There are no scratches, so...\" The prince withdrew his hand. \"Maester, could I trouble you for some milk of the poppy? A thimble cup will suffice.\" \"The poppy. Yes, to be sure.\" \"Now, I think,\" Doran Martell urged gently, and Caleotte scurried to the stairs. Outside the sun had set. The light within the dome was the blue of dusk, and all the diamonds on the floor were dying. The prince sat in his high seat beneath the Martell spear, his face pale with pain. After a long silence he turned to Areo Hotah. \"Captain,\" he said, \"how loyal are my guards?\" \"Loyal.\" The captain did not know what else to say. \"All of them? Or some?\" \"They are good men. Good Dornishmen. They will do as I command.\" He thumped his longaxe on the floor. \"I will bring the head of any man who would betray you.\" \"I want no heads. I want obedience.\" \"You have it.\" Serve. Obey. Protect. Simple vows for a simple man. \"How many men are needed?\" \"I will leave that for you to decide. It may be that a few good men will serve us better than a score. I want this done as quickly and as quietly as possible, with no blood spilled.\" \"Quick and quiet and bloodless, aye. What is your command?\" \"You will find my brother\'s daughters, take them into custody, and confine them in the cells atop the Spear Tower.\" \"The Sand Snakes?\" The captain\'s throat was dry. \"All... all eight, my prince? The little ones, also?\" The prince considered. \"Ellaria\'s girls are too young to be a danger, but there are those who might seek to use them against me. It would be best to keep them safe in hand. Yes, the little ones as well... but first secure Tyene, Nymeria, and Obara.\" \"As my prince commands.\" His heart was troubled. My little princess will mislike this. \"What of Sarella? She is a woman grown, almost twenty.\" \"Unless she returns to Dorne, there\'s naught I can do about Sarella save pray that she shows more sense than her sisters. Leave her to her... game. Gather up the others. I shall not sleep until I know that they are safe and under guard.\" \"It will be done.\" The captain hesitated. \"When this is known in the streets, the common folk will howl.\" \"All Dorne will howl,\" said Doran Martell in a tired voice. \"I only pray Lord Tywin hears them in King\'s Landing, so he might know what a loyal friend he has in Sunspear.\"');
INSERT INTO `books` VALUES ('ASOIAF','AFFC',3,'Cersei I','Cersei Lannister','She dreamt she sat the Iron Throne, high above them all. The courtiers were brightly colored mice below. Great lords and proud ladies knelt before her. Bold young knights laid their swords at her feet and pleaded for her favors, and the queen smiled down at them. Until the dwarf appeared as if from nowhere, pointing at her and howling with laughter. The lords and ladies began to chuckle too, hiding their smiles behind their hands. Only then did the queen realize she was naked. Horrified, she tried to cover herself with her hands. The barbs and blades of the Iron Throne bit into her flesh as she crouched to hide her shame. Blood ran red down her legs, as steel teeth gnawed at her buttocks. When she tried to stand, her foot slipped through a gap in the twisted metal. The more she struggled the more the throne engulfed her, tearing chunks of flesh from her breasts and belly, slicing at her arms and legs until they were slick and red, glistening. And all the while her brother capered below, laughing. His merriment still echoed in her ears when she felt a light touch on her shoulder, and woke suddenly. For half a heartbeat the hand seemed part of the nightmare, and Cersei cried out, but it was only Senelle. The maid\'s face was white and frightened. We are not alone, the queen realized. Shadows loomed around her bed, tall shapes with chainmail glimmering beneath their cloaks. Armed men had no business here. Where are my guards? Her bedchamber was dark, but for the lantern one of the intruders held on high. I must show no fear. Cersei pushed back sleep-tousled hair, and said, \"What do you want of me?\" A man stepped into the lantern light, and she saw his cloak was white. \"Jaime?\" I dreamt of one brother, but the other has come to wake me. \"Your Grace.\" The voice was not her brother\'s. \"The Lord Commander said come get you.\" His hair curled, as Jaime\'s did, but her brother\'s hair was beaten gold, like hers, where this man\'s was black and oily. She stared at him, confused, as he muttered about a privy and a crossbow, and said her father\'s name. I am dreaming still, Cersei thought. I have not woken, nor has my nightmare ended. Tyrion will creep out from under the bed soon and begin to laugh at me. But that was folly. Her dwarf brother was down in the black cells, condemned to die this very day. She looked down at her hands, turning them over to make certain all her fingers were still there. When she ran a hand down her arm the skin was covered with gooseprickles, but unbroken. There were no cuts on her legs, no gashes on the soles of her feet. A dream, that\'s all it was, a dream. I drank too much last night, these fears are only humors born of wine. I will be the one laughing, come dusk. My children will be safe, Tommen\'s throne will be secure, and my twisted little valonqar will be short a head and rotting. Jocelyn Swyft was at her elbow, pressing a cup on her. Cersei took a sip: water, mixed with lemon squeezings, so tart she spit it out. She could hear the night wind rattling the shutters, and she saw with a strange sharp clarity. Jocelyn was trembling like a leaf, as frightened as Senelle. Ser Osmund Kettleblack loomed over her. Behind him stood Ser Boros Blount, with a lantern. At the door were Lannister guardsmen with gilded lions shining on the crests of their helmets. They looked afraid as well. Can it be? the queen wondered. Can it be true? She rose, and let Senelle slip a bedrobe over her shoulders to hide her nakedness. Cersei belted it herself, her fingers stiff and clumsy. \"My lord father keeps guards about him, night and day,\" she said. Her tongue felt thick. She took another swallow of lemon water and sloshed it round her mouth to freshen her breath. A moth had gotten into the lantern Ser Boros was holding; she could hear it buzzing and see the shadow of its wings as it beat against the glass. \"The guards were at their posts, Your Grace,\" said Osmund Kettleblack. \"We found a hidden door behind the hearth. A secret passage. The Lord Commander\'s gone down to see where it goes.\" \"Jaime?\" Terror seized her, sudden as a storm. \"Jaime should be with the king...\" \"The lad\'s not been harmed. Ser Jaime sent a dozen men to look in on him. His Grace is sleeping peaceful.\" Let him have a sweeter dream than mine, and a kinder waking. \"Who is with the king?\" \"Ser Loras has that honor, if it please you.\" It did not please her. The Tyrells were only stewards that the dragon-kings had upjumped far above their station. Their vanity was exceeded only by their ambition. Ser Loras might be as pretty as a maiden\'s dream, but underneath his white cloak he was Tyrell to the bone. For all she knew, this night\'s foul fruit had been planted and nurtured in Highgarden. But that was a suspicion she dare not speak aloud. \"Allow me a moment to dress. Ser Osmund, you shall accompany me to the Tower of the Hand. Ser Boros, roust the gaolers and make certain the dwarf is still in his cell.\" She would not say his name. He would never have found the courage to lift a hand against Father, she told herself, but she had to be certain. \"As Your Grace commands.\" Blount surrendered the lantern to Ser Osmund. Cersei was not displeased to see the back of him. Father should never have restored him to the white. The man had proved himself a craven. By the time they left Maegor\'s Holdfast, the sky had turned a deep cobalt blue, though the stars still shone. All but one, Cersei thought. The bright star of the west has fallen, and the nights will be darker now. She paused upon the drawbridge that spanned the dry moat, gazing down at the spikes below. They would not dare lie to me about such a thing. \"Who found him?\" \"One of his guards,\" said Ser Osmund. \"Lum. He felt a call of nature, and found his lordship in the privy.\" No, that cannot be. That is not the way a lion dies. The queen felt strangely calm. She remembered the first time she had lost a tooth, when she was just a little girl. It hadn\'t hurt, but the hole in her mouth felt so odd she could not stop touching it with her tongue. Now there is a hole in the world where Father stood, and holes want filling. If Tywin Lannister was truly dead, no one was safe... least of all her son upon his throne. When the lion falls the lesser beasts move in: the jackals and the vultures and the feral dogs. They would try to push her aside, as they always had. She would need to move quickly, as she had when Robert died. This might be the work of Stannis Baratheon, through some catspaw. It could well be the prelude to another attack upon the city. She hoped it was. Let him come. I will smash him, just as Father did, and this time he will die. Stannis did not frighten her, no more than Mace Tyrell did. No one frightened her. She was a daughter of the Rock, a lion. There will be no more talk of forcing me to wed again. Casterly Rock was hers now, and all the power of House Lannister. No one would ever disregard her again. Even when Tommen had no further need of a regent, the Lady of Casterly Rock would remain a power in the land. The rising sun had painted the tower tops a vivid red, but beneath the walls the night still huddled. The outer castle was so hushed that she could have believed all its people dead. They should be. It is not fitting for Tywin Lannister to die alone. Such a man deserves a retinue to attend his needs in hell. Four spearmen in red cloaks and lion-crested helms were posted at the door of the Tower of the Hand. \"No one is to enter or leave without my permission,\" she told them. The command came easily to her. My father had steel in his voice as well. Within the tower, the smoke from the torches irritated her eyes, but Cersei did not weep, no more than her father would have. I am the only true son he ever had. Her heels scraped against the stone as she climbed, and she could still hear the moth fluttering wildly inside Ser Osmund\'s lantern. Die, the queen thought at it, in irritation, fly into the flame and be done with it. Two more red-cloaked guardsmen stood atop the steps. Red Lester muttered a condolence as she passed. The queen\'s breath was coming fast and short, and she could feel her heart fluttering in her chest. The steps, she told herself, this cursed tower has too many steps. She had half a mind to tear it down. The hall was full of fools speaking in whispers, as if Lord Tywin were asleep and they were afraid to wake him. Guards and servants alike shrank back before her, mouths flapping. She saw their pink gums and waggling tongues, but their words made no more sense than the buzzing of the moth. What are they doing here? How did they know? By rights they should have called her first. She was the Queen Regent, had they forgotten that? Before the Hand\'s bedchamber stood Ser Meryn Trant in his white armor and cloak. The visor of his helm was open, and the bags beneath his eyes made him look still half-asleep. \"Clear these people away,\" Cersei told him. \"Is my father in the privy?\" \"They carried him back to his bed, m\'lady.\" Ser Meryn pushed the door open for her to enter. Morning light slashed through the shutters to paint golden bars upon the rushes strewn across the floor of the bedchamber. Her uncle Kevan was on his knees beside the bed, trying to pray, but he could scarcely get the words out. Guardsmen clustered near the hearth. The secret door that Ser Osmund had spoken of gaped open behind the ashes, no bigger than an oven. A man would need to crawl. But Tyrion is only half a man. The thought made her angry. No, the dwarf is locked in a black cell. This could not be his work. Stannis, she told herself, Stannis was behind it. He still has adherents in the city. Him, or the Tyrells... There had always been talk of secret passages within the Red Keep. Maegor the Cruel was supposed to have killed the men who built the castle to keep the knowledge of them secret. How many other bedchambers have hidden doors? Cersei had a sudden vision of the dwarf crawling out from behind a tapestry in Tommen\'s bedchamber with blade in hand. Tommen is well guarded, she told herself. But Lord Tywin had been well guarded too. For a moment she did not recognize the dead man. He had hair like her father, yes, but this was some other man, surely, a smaller man, and much older. His bedrobe was hiked up around his chest, leaving him naked below the waist. The quarrel had taken him in his groin between his navel and his manhood, and was sunk so deep that only the fletching showed. His pubic hair was stiff with dried blood. More was congealing in his navel. The smell of him made her wrinkle her nose. \"Take the quarrel out of him,\" she commanded. \"This is the King\'s Hand!\" And my father. My lord father. Should I scream and tear my hair? They said Catelyn Stark had clawed her own face to bloody ribbons when the Freys slew her precious Robb. Would you like that, Father? she wanted to ask him. Or would you want me to be strong? Did you weep for your own father? Her grandfather had died when she was only a year old, but she knew the story. Lord Tytos had grown very fat, and his heart burst one day when he was climbing the steps to his mistress. Her father was off in King\'s Landing when it happened, serving as the Mad King\'s Hand. Lord Tywin was often away in King\'s Landing when she and Jaime were young. If he wept when they brought him word of his father\'s death, he did it where no one could see the tears. The queen could feel her nails digging into her palms. \"How could you leave him like this? My father was Hand to three kings, as great a man as ever strode the Seven Kingdoms. The bells must ring for him, as they rang for Robert. He must be bathed and dressed as befits his stature, in ermine and cloth-of-gold and crimson silk. Where is Pycelle? Where is Pycelle?\" She turned to the guardsmen. \"Puckens, bring Grand Maester Pycelle. He must see to Lord Tywin.\" \"He\'s seen him, Your Grace,\" said Puckens. \"He came and saw and went, to summon the silent sisters.\" They sent for me last. The realization made her almost too angry for words. And Pycelle runs off to send a message rather than soil his soft, wrinkled hands. The man is useless. \"Find Maester Ballabar,\" she commanded. \"Find Maester Frenken. Any of them.\" Puckens and Shortear ran to obey. \"Where is my brother?\" \"Down the tunnel. There\'s a shaft, with iron rungs set in the stone. Ser Jaime went to see how deep it goes.\" He has only one hand, she wanted to shout at them. One of you should have gone. He has no business climbing ladders. The men who murdered Father might be down there, waiting for him. Her twin had always been too rash, and it would seem that even losing a hand had not taught him caution. She was about to command the guards to go down after him and bring him back when Puckens and Shortear returned with a grey-haired man between them. \"Your Grace,\" said Shortear, \"this here claims he was a maester.\" The man bowed low. \"How may I serve Your Grace?\" His face was vaguely familiar, though Cersei could not place him. Old, but not so old as Pycelle. This one has some strength in him still. He was tall, though slightly stooped, with crinkles around his bold blue eyes. His throat is naked. \"You wear no maester\'s chain.\" \"It was taken from me. My name is Qyburn, if it please Your Grace. I treated your brother\'s hand.\" \"His stump, you mean.\" She remembered him now. He had come with Jaime from Harrenhal. \"I could not save Ser Jaime\'s hand, it is true. My arts saved his arm, however, mayhaps his very life. The Citadel took my chain, but they could not take my knowledge.\" \"You may suffice,\" she decided. \"If you fail me you will lose more than a chain, I promise you. Remove the quarrel from my father\'s belly and make him ready for the silent sisters.\" \"As my queen commands.\" Qyburn went to the bedside, paused, looked back. \"And how shall I deal with the girl, Your Grace?\" \"Girl?\" Cersei had overlooked the second body. She strode to the bed, flung aside the heap of bloody coverlets, and there she was, naked, cold, and pink... save for her face, which had turned as black as Joff\'s had at his wedding feast. A chain of linked golden hands was half-buried in the flesh of her throat, twisted so tight that it had broken the skin. Cersei hissed like an angry cat. \"What is she doing here?\" \"We found her there, Your Grace,\" said Shortear. \"It\'s the Imp\'s whore.\" As if that explained why she was here. My lord father had no use for whores, she thought. After our mother died he never touched a woman. She gave the guardsman a chilly look. \"This is not... when Lord Tywin\'s father died he returned to Casterly Rock to find a... a woman of this sort... bedecked in his lady mother\'s jewels, wearing one of her gowns. He stripped them off her, and all else as well. For a fortnight she was paraded naked through the streets of Lannisport, to confess to every man she met that she was a thief and a harlot. That was how Lord Tywin Lannister dealt with whores. He never... this woman was here for some other purpose, not for...\" \"Perhaps his lordship was questioning the girl about her mistress,\" Qyburn suggested. \"Sansa Stark vanished the night the king was murdered, I have heard.\" \"That\'s so.\" Cersei seized on the suggestion eagerly. \"He was questioning her, to be sure. There can be no doubt.\" She could see Tyrion leering, his mouth twisted into a monkey\'s grin beneath the ruin of his nose. And what better way to question her than naked, with her legs well spread? the dwarf whispered. That\'s how I like to question her too. The queen turned away. I will not look at her. Suddenly it was too much even to be in the same room as the dead woman. She pushed past Qyburn, out into the hall. Ser Osmund had been joined by his brothers Osney and Osfryd. \"There is a dead woman in the Hand\'s bedchamber,\" Cersei told the three Kettleblacks. \"No one is ever to know that she was here.\" \"Aye, m\'lady.\" Ser Osney had faint scratches on his cheek where another of Tyrion\'s whores had clawed him. \"And what shall we do with her?\" \"Feed her to your dogs. Keep her for a bedmate. What do I care? She was never here. I\'ll have the tongue of any man who dares to say she was. Do you understand me?\" Osney and Osfryd exchanged a look. \"Aye, Your Grace.\" She followed them back inside and watched as they bundled the girl up in her father\'s bloody blankets. Shae, her name was Shae. They had last spoken the night before the dwarf\'s trial by combat, after that smiling Dornish snake offered to champion him. Shae had been asking about some jewels Tyrion had given her, and certain promises Cersei might have made, a manse in the city and a knight to marry her. The queen made it plain that the whore would have nothing of her until she told them where Sansa Stark had gone. \"You were her maid. Do you expect me to believe that you knew nothing of her plans?\" she had said. Shae left in tears. Ser Osfryd slung the bundled corpse up over his shoulder. \"I want that chain,\" Cersei said. \"See that you do not scratch the gold.\" Osfryd nodded and started toward the door. \"No, not through the yard.\" She gestured toward the secret passage. \"There\'s a shaft down to the dungeons. That way.\" As Ser Osfryd went down on one knee before the hearth, the light brightened within, and the queen heard noises. Jaime emerged bent over like an old woman, his boots kicking up puffs of soot from Lord Tywin\'s last fire. \"Get out of my way,\" he told the Kettleblacks. Cersei rushed toward him. \"Did you find them? Did you find the killers? How many were there?\" Surely there had been more than one. One man alone could not have killed her father. Her twin\'s face had a haggard look. \"The shaft goes down to a chamber where half a dozen tunnels meet. They\'re closed off by iron gates, chained and locked. I need to find keys.\" He glanced around the bedchamber. \"Whoever did this might still be lurking in the walls. It\'s a maze back there, and dark.\" She imagined Tyrion creeping between the walls like some monstrous rat. No. You are being silly. The dwarf is in his cell. \"Take hammers to the walls. Knock this tower down, if you must. I want them found. Whoever did this. I want them killed.\" Jaime hugged her, his good hand pressing against the small of her back. He smelled of ash, but the morning sun was in his hair, giving it a golden glow. She wanted to draw his face to hers for a kiss. Later, she told herself, later he will come to me, for comfort. \"We are his heirs, Jaime,\" she whispered. \"It will be up to us to finish his work. You must take Father\'s place as Hand. You see that now, surely. Tommen will need you...\" He pushed away from her and raised his arm, forcing his stump into her face. \"A Hand without a hand? A bad jape, sister. Don\'t ask me to rule.\" Their uncle heard the rebuff. Qyburn as well, and the Kettleblacks, wrestling their bundle through the ashes. Even the guardsmen heard, Puckens and Hoke the Horseleg and Shortear. It will be all over the castle by nightfall. Cersei felt the heat rising up her cheeks. \"Rule? I said naught of ruling. I shall rule until my son comes of age.\" \"I don\'t know who I pity more,\" her brother said. \"Tommen, or the Seven Kingdoms.\" She slapped him. Jaime\'s arm rose to catch the blow, cat-quick... but this cat had a cripple\'s stump in place of a right hand. Her fingers left red marks on his cheek. The sound brought their uncle to his feet. \"Your father lies here dead. Have the decency to take your quarrel outside.\" Jaime inclined his head in apology. \"Forgive us, Uncle. My sister is sick with grief. She forgets herself.\" She wanted to slap him again for that. I must have been mad to think he could be Hand. She would sooner abolish the office. When had a Hand ever brought her anything but grief? Jon Arryn put Robert Baratheon in her bed, and before he died he\'d begun sniffing about her and Jaime as well. Eddard Stark took up right where Arryn had left off; his meddling had forced her to rid herself of Robert sooner than she would have liked, before she could deal with his pestilential brothers. Tyrion sold Myrcella to the Dornishmen, made one of her sons his hostage, and murdered the other. And when Lord Tywin returned to King\'s Landing... The next Hand will know his place, she promised herself. It would have to be Ser Kevan. Her uncle was tireless, prudent, unfailingly obedient. She could rely on him, as her father had. The hand does not argue with the head. She had a realm to rule, but she would need new men to help her rule it. Pycelle was a doddering lickspittle, Jaime had lost his courage with his sword hand, and Mace Tyrell and his cronies Redwyne and Rowan could not be trusted. For all she knew they might have had a part in this. Lord Tyrell had to know that he would never rule the Seven Kingdoms so long as Tywin Lannister lived. I will need to move carefully with that one. The city was full of his men, and he\'d even managed to plant one of his sons in the Kingsguard, and meant to plant his daughter in Tommen\'s bed. It still made her furious to think that Father had agreed to betroth Tommen to Margaery Tyrell. The girl is twice his age and twice widowed. Mace Tyrell claimed his daughter was still virgin, but Cersei had her doubts. Joffrey had been murdered before he could bed the girl, but she had been wed to Renly first... A man may prefer the taste of hippocras, yet if you set a tankard of ale before him, he will quaff it quick enough. She must command Lord Varys to find out what he could. That stopped her where she stood. She had forgotten about Varys. He should be here. He is always here. Whenever anything of import happened in the Red Keep, the eunuch appeared as if from nowhere. Jaime is here, and Uncle Kevan, and Pycelle has come and gone, but not Varys. A cold finger touched her spine. He was part of this. He must have feared that Father meant to have his head, so he struck first. Lord Tywin had never had any love for the simpering master of whisperers. And if any man knew the Red Keep\'s secrets, it was surely the master of whisperers. He must have made common cause with Lord Stannis. They served together on Robert\'s council, after all... Cersei strode to the door of the bedchamber, to Ser Meryn Trant. \"Trant, bring me Lord Varys. Squealing and squirming if need be, but unharmed.\" \"As Your Grace commands.\" But no sooner had one Kingsguard departed than another one returned. Ser Boros Blount was red-faced and puffing from his headlong rush up the steps. \"Gone,\" he panted, when he saw the queen. He sank to one knee. \"The Imp... his cell\'s open, Your Grace... no sign of him anywhere...\" The dream was true. \"I gave orders,\" she said. \"He was to be kept under guard, night and day...\" Blount\'s chest was heaving. \"One of the gaolers has gone missing too. Rugen, his name was. Two other men we found asleep.\" It was all she could do not to scream. \"I hope you did not wake them, Ser Boros. Let them sleep.\" \"Sleep?\" He looked up, jowly and confused. \"Aye, Your Grace. How long shall-\" \"Forever. See that they sleep forever, ser. I will not suffer guards to sleep on watch.\" He is in the walls. He killed Father as he killed Mother, as he killed Joff. The dwarf would come for her as well, the queen knew, just as the old woman had promised her in the dimness of that tent. I laughed in her face, but she had powers. I saw my future in a drop of blood. My doom. Her legs were weak as water. Ser Boros tried to take her by the arm, but the queen recoiled from his touch. For all she knew he might be one of Tyrion\'s creatures. \"Get away from me,\" she said. \"Get away!\" She staggered to a settle. \"Your Grace?\" said Blount. \"Shall I fetch a cup of water?\" It is blood I need, not water. Tyrion\'s blood, the blood of the valonqar. The torches spun around her. Cersei closed her eyes, and saw the dwarf grinning at her. No, she thought, no, I was almost rid of you. But his fingers had closed around her neck, and she could feel them beginning to tighten.');

INSERT INTO `books` VALUES ('ASOIAF','AGOT',20,'Eddard IV','Eddard Stark','Eddard Stark rode through the towering bronze doors of the Red Keep sore, tired, hungry, and irritable. He was still a horse, dreaming of a long hot soak, a roast fowl, and a featherbed, when the king\'s steward told him that Grand Maester Pycelle had convened an urgent meeting of the small council. The honor of the Hand\'s presence was requested as soon as it was convenient. \"It will be convenient on the morrow,\" Ned snapped as he dismounted. The steward bowed very low. \"I shall give the councillors your regrets, my lord.\" \"No, damn it,\" Ned said. It would not do to offend the council before he had even begun. \"I will see them. Pray give me a few moments to change into something more presentable.\" \"Yes, my lord,\" the steward said. \"We have given you Lord Arryn\'s former chambers in the Tower of the Hand, if it please you. I shall have your things taken there.\" \"My thanks,\" Ned said as he ripped off his riding gloves and tucked them into his belt. The rest of his household was coming through the gate behind him. Ned saw Vayon Poole, his own steward, and called out. \"It seems the council has urgent need of me. See that my daughters find their bedchambers, and tell Jory to keep them there. Arya is not to go exploring.\" Poole bowed. Ned turned back to the royal steward. \"My wagons are still straggling through the city. I shall need appropriate garments.\" \"It will be my great pleasure,\" the steward said. And so Ned had come striding into the council chambers, bonetired and dressed in borrowed clothing, to find four members of the small council waiting for him. The chamber was richly furnished. Myrish carpets covered the floor instead of rushes, and in one corner a hundred fabulous beasts cavorted in bright paints on a carved screen from the Summer Isles. The walls were hung with tapestries from Norvos and Qohor and Lys, and a pair of Valyrian sphinxes flanked the door, eyes of polished garnet smoldering in black marble faces. The councillor Ned liked least, the eunuch Varys, accosted him the moment he entered. \"Lord Stark, I was grievous sad to hear about your troubles on the kingsroad. We have all been visiting the sept to light candles for Prince Joffrey. I pray for his recovery.\" His hand left powder stains on Ned\'s sleeve, and he smelled as foul and sweet as flowers on a grave. \"Your gods have heard you,\" Ned replied, cool yet polite. \"The prince grows stronger every day.\" He disentangled himself from the eunuch\'s grip and crossed the room to where Lord Renly stood by the screen, talking quietly with a short man who could only be Littlefinger. Renly had been a boy of eight when Robert won the throne, but he had grown into a man so like his brother that Ned found it disconcerting. Whenever he saw him, it was as if the years had slipped away and Robert stood before him, fresh from his victory on the Trident. \"I see you have arrived safely, Lord Stark,\" Renly said. \"And you as well,\" Ned replied. \"You must forgive me, but sometimes you look the very image of your brother Robert.\" \"A poor copy,\" Renly said with a shrug. \"Though much better dressed,\" Littlefinger quipped. \"Lord Renly spends more on clothing than half the ladies of the court.\" It was true enough. Lord Renly was in dark green velvet, with a dozen golden stags embroidered on his doublet. A cloth-of-gold half cape was draped casually across one shoulder, fastened with an emerald brooch. \"There are worse crimes,\" Renly said with a laugh. \"The way you dress, for one.\" Littlefinger ignored the jibe. He eyed Ned with a smile on his lips that bordered on insolence. \"I have hoped to meet you for some years, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me to you.\" \"She has,\" Ned replied with a chill in his voice. The sly arrogance of the comment rankled him. \"I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.\" Renly Baratheon laughed. Varys shuffled over to listen. \"Rather too well,\" Littlefinger said. \"I still carry a token of his esteem. Did Brandon speak of me too?\" \"Often, and with some heat,\" Ned said, hoping that would end it. He had no patience with this game they played, this dueling with words. \"I should have thought that heat ill suits you Starks,\" Littlefinger said. \"Here in the south, they say you are all made of ice, and melt when you ride below the Neck.\" \"I do not plan on melting soon, Lord Baelish. You may count on it.\" Ned moved to the council table and said, \"Maester Pycelle, I trust you are well.\" The Grand Maester smiled gently from his tall chair at the foot of the table. \"Well enough for a man of my years, my lord,\" he replied, \"yet I do tire easily, I fear.\" Wispy strands of white hair fringed the broad bald dome of his forehead above a kindly face. His maester\'s collar was no simple metal choker such as Luwin wore, but two dozen heavy chains wound together into a ponderous metal necklace that covered him from throat to breast. The links were forged of every metal known to man: black iron and red gold, bright copper and dull lead, steel and tin and pale silver, brass and bronze and platinum. Garnets and amethysts and black pearls adorned the metalwork, and here and there an emerald or ruby. \"Perhaps we might begin soon,\" the Grand Maester said, hands knitting together atop his broad stomach. \"I fear I shall fall asleep if we wait much longer.\" \"As you will.\" The king\'s seat sat empty at the head of the table, the crowned stag of Baratheon embroidered in gold thread on its pillows. Ned took the chair beside it, as the right hand of his king. \"My lords,\" he said formally, \"I am sorry to have kept you waiting.\" \"You are the King\'s Hand,\" Varys said. \"We serve at your pleasure, Lord Stark.\" As the others took their accustomed seats, it struck Eddard Stark forcefully that he did not belong here, in this room, with these men. He remembered what Robert had told him in the crypts below Winterfell. I am surrounded by flatterers and fools, the king had insisted. Ned looked down the council table and wondered which were the flatterers and which the fools. He thought he knew already. \"We are but five,\" he pointed out. \"Lord Stannis took himself to Dragonstone not long after the king went north,\" Varys said, \"and our gallant Ser Barristan no doubt rides beside the king as he makes his way through the city, as befits the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.\" \"Perhaps we had best wait for Ser Barristan and the king to join us,\" Ned suggested. Renly Baratheon laughed aloud. \"If we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence, it could be a long sit.\" \"Our good King Robert has many cares,\" Varys said. \"He entrusts some small matters to us, to lighten his load.\" \"What Lord Varys means is that all this business of coin and crops and justice bores my royal brother to tears,\" Lord Renly said, \"so it falls to us to govern the realm. He does send us a command from time to time.\" He drew a tightly rolled paper from his sleeve and laid it on the table. \"This morning he commanded me to ride ahead with all haste and ask Grand Maester Pycelle to convene this council at once. He has an urgent task for us.\" Littlefinger smiled and handed the paper to Ned. It bore the royal seal. Ned broke the wax with his thumb and flattened the letter to consider the king\'s urgent command, reading the words with mounting disbelief. Was there no end to Robert\'s folly? And to do this in his name, that was salt in the wound. \"Gods be good,\" he swore. \"What Lord Eddard means to say,\" Lord Renly announced, \"is that His Grace instructs us to stage a great tournament in honor of his appointment as the Hand of the King.\" \"How much?\" asked Littlefinger, mildly. Ned read the answer off the letter. \"Forty thousand golden dragons to the champion. Twenty thousand to the man who comes second, another twenty to the winner of the melee, and ten thousand to the victor of the archery competition.\" \"Ninety thousand gold pieces,\" Littlefinger sighed. \"And we must not neglect the other costs. Robert will want a prodigious feast. That means cooks, carpenters, serving girls, singers, jugglers, fools \"Fools we have in plenty,\" Lord Renly said. Grand Maester Pycelle looked to Littlefinger and asked, \"Will the treasury bear the expense?\" \"What treasury is that?\" Littlefinger replied with a twist of his mouth. \"Spare me the foolishness, Maester. You know as well as I that the treasury has been empty for years. I shall have to borrow the money. No doubt the Lannisters will be accommodating. We owe Lord Tywin some three million dragons at present, what matter another hundred thousand?\" Ned was stunned. \"Are you claiming that the Crown is three million gold pieces in debt?\" \"The Crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt, Lord Stark. The Lannisters are the biggest part of it, but we have also borrowed from Lord Tyrell, the Iron Bank of Braavos, and several Tyroshi trading cartels. Of late I\'ve had to turn to the Faith. The High Septon haggles worse than a Dornish fishmonger.\" Ned was aghast. \"Aerys Targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold. How could you let this happen?\" Littlefinger gave a shrug. \"The master of coin finds the money. The king and the Hand spend it.\" \"I will not believe that Jon Arryn allowed Robert to beggar the realm,\" Ned said hotly. Grand Maester Pycelle shook his great bald head, his chains clinking softly. \"Lord Arryn was a prudent man, but I fear that His Grace does not always listen to wise counsel.\" \"My royal brother loves tournaments and feasts,\" Renly Baratheon said, \"and he loathes what he calls \'counting coppers.\' \" \"I will speak with His Grace,\" Ned said. \"This tourney is an extravagance the realm cannot afford.\" \"Speak to him as you will,\" Lord Renly said, \"we had still best make our plans.\" \"Another day,\" Ned said. Perhaps too sharply, from the looks they gave him. He would have to remember that he was no longer in Winterfell, where only the king stood higher; here, he was but first among equals. \"Forgive me, my lords,\" he said in a softer tone. \"I am tired. Let us call a halt for today and resume when we are fresher.\" He did not ask for their consent, but stood abruptly, nodded at them all, and made for the door. Outside, wagons and riders were still pouring through the castle gates, and the yard was a chaos of mud and horseflesh and shouting men. The king had not yet arrived, he was told. Since the ugliness on the Trident, the Starks and their household had ridden well ahead of the main column, the better to separate themselves from the Lannisters and the growing tension. Robert had hardly been seen; the talk was he was traveling in the huge wheelhouse, drunk as often as not. If so, he might be hours behind, but he would still be here too soon for Ned\'s liking. He had only to look at Sansa\'s face to feel the rage twisting inside him once again. The last fortnight of their journey had been a misery. Sansa blamed Arya and told her that it should have been Nymeria who died. And Arya was lost after she heard what had happened to her butcher\'s boy. Sansa cried herself to sleep, Arya brooded silently all day long, and Eddard Stark dreamed of a frozen hell reserved for the Starks of Winterfell. He crossed the outer yard, passed under a portcullis into the inner bailey, and was walking toward what he thought was the Tower of the Hand when Littlefinger appeared in front of him. \"You\'re going the wrong way, Stark. Come with me.\" Hesitantly, Ned followed. Littlefinger led him into a tower, down a stair, across a small sunken courtyard, and along a deserted corridor where empty suits of armor stood sentinel along the walls. They were relics of the Targaryens, black steel with dragon scales cresting their helms, now dusty and forgotten. \"This is not the way to my chambers,\" Ned said. \"Did I say it was? I\'m leading you to the dungeons to slit your throat and seal your corpse up behind a wall,\" Littlefinger replied, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"We have no time for this, Stark. Your wife awaits.\" \"What game are you playing, Littlefinger? Catelyn is at Winterfell, hundreds of leagues from here.\" \"Oh?\" Littlefinger\'s grey-green eyes glittered with amusement. \"Then it appears someone has managed an astonishing impersonation. For the last time, come. Or don\'t come, and I\'ll keep her for myself.\" He hurried down the steps. Ned followed him warily, wondering if this day would ever end. He had no taste for these intrigues, but he was beginning to realize that they were meat and mead to a man like Littlefinger. At the foot of the steps was a heavy door of oak and iron. Petyr Baelish lifted the crossbar and gestured Ned through. They stepped out into the ruddy glow of dusk, on a rocky bluff high above the river. \"We\'re outside the castle,\" Ned said. \"You are a hard man to fool, Stark,\" Littlefinger said with a smirk. \"Was it the sun that gave it away, or the sky? Follow me. There are niches cut in the rock. Try not to fall to your death, Catelyn would never understand.\" With that, he was over the side of the cliff, descending as quick as a monkey. Ned studied the rocky face of the bluff for a moment, then followed more slowly. The niches were there, as Littlefinger had promised, shallow cuts that would be invisible from below, unless you knew just where to look for them. The river was a long, dizzying distance below. Ned kept his face pressed to the rock and tried not to look down any more often than he had to. When at last he reached the bottom, a narrow, muddy trail along the water\'s edge, Littlefinger was lazing against a rock and eating an apple. He was almost down to the core. \"You are growing old and slow, Stark,\" he said, flipping the apple casually into the rushing water. \"No matter, we ride the rest of the way.\" He had two horses waiting. Ned mounted up and trotted behind him, down the trail and into the city. Finally Baelish drew rein in front of a ramshackle building, three stories, timbered, its windows bright with lamplight in the gathering dusk. The sounds of music and raucous laughter drifted out and floated over the water. Beside the door swung an ornate oil lamp on a heavy chain, with a globe of leaded red glass. Ned Stark dismounted in a fury. \"A brothel,\" he said as he seized Littlefinger by the shoulder and spun him around. \"You\'ve brought me all this way to take me to a brothel.\" \"Your wife is inside,\" Littlefinger said. It was the final insult. \"Brandon was too kind to you,\" Ned said as he slammed the small man back against a wall and shoved his dagger up under the little pointed chin beard. \"My lord, no,\" an urgent voice called out. \"He speaks the truth.\" There were footsteps behind him. Ned spun, knife in hand, as an old white-haired man hurried toward them. He was dressed in brown roughspun, and the soft flesh under his chin wobbled as he ran. \"This is no business of yours,\" Ned began; then, suddenly, the recognition came. He lowered the dagger, astonished. \"Ser Rodrik?\" Rodrik Cassel nodded. \"Your lady awaits you upstairs.\" Ned was lost. \"Catelyn is truly here? This is not some strange jape of Littlefinger\'s?\" He sheathed his blade. \"Would that it were, Stark,\" Littlefinger said. \"Follow me, and try to look a shade more lecherous and a shade less like the King\'s Hand. It would not do to have you recognized. Perhaps you could fondle a breast or two, just in passing.\" They went inside, through a crowded common room where a fat woman was singing bawdy songs while pretty young girls in linen shifts and wisps of colored silk pressed themselves against their lovers and dandled on their laps. No one paid Ned the least bit of attention. Ser Rodrik waited below while Littlefinger led him up to the third floor, along a corridor, and through a door. Inside, Catelyn was waiting. She cried out when she saw him, ran to him, and embraced him fiercely. \"My lady,\" Ned whispered in wonderment. \"Oh, very good,\" said Littlefinger, closing the door. \"You recognized her.\" \"I feared you\'d never come, my lord,\" she whispered against his chest. \"Petyr has been bringing me reports. He told me of your troubles with Arya and the young prince. How are my girls?\" \"Both in mourning, and full of anger,\" he told her. \"Cat, I do not understand. What are you doing in King\'s Landing? What\'s happened?\" Ned asked his wife. \"Is it Bran? Is he...\" Dead was the word that came to his lips, but he could not say it. \"It is Bran, but not as you think,\" Catelyn said. Ned was lost. \"Then how? Why are you here, my love? What is this place?\" \"Just what it appears,\" Littlefinger said, easing himself onto a window seat. \"A brothel. Can you think of a less likely place to find a Catelyn Tully?\" He smiled. \"As it chances, I own this particular establishment, so arrangements were easily made. I am most anxious to keep the Lannisters from learning that Cat is here in King\'s Landing.\" \"Why?\" Ned asked. He saw her hands then, the awkward way she held them, the raw red scars, the stiffness of the last two fingers on her left. \"You\'ve been hurt.\" He took her hands in his own, turned them over. \"Gods. Those are deep cuts... a gash from a sword or... how did this happen, my lady?\" Catelyn slid a dagger out from under her cloak and placed it in his hand. \"This blade was sent to open Bran\'s throat and spill his life\'s blood.\" Ned\'s head jerked up. \"But... who... why would.\" She put a finger to his lips. \"Let me tell it all, my love. It will go faster that way. Listen.\" So he listened, and she told it all, from the fire in the library tower to Varys and the guardsmen and Littlefinger. And when she was done, Eddard Stark sat dazed beside the table, the dagger in his hand. Bran\'s wolf had saved the boy\'s life, he thought dully. What was it that Jon had said when they found the pups in the snow? Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord. And he had killed Sansa\'s, and for what? Was it guilt he was feeling? Or fear? If the gods had sent these wolves, what folly had he done? Painfully, Ned forced his thoughts back to the dagger and what it meant. \"The Imp\'s dagger,\" he repeated. It made no sense. His hand curled around the smooth dragonbone hilt, and he slammed the blade into the table, felt it bite into the wood. It stood mocking him. \"Why should Tyrion Lannister want Bran dead? The boy has never done him harm.\" \"Do you Starks have nought but snow between your ears?\" Littlefinger asked. \"The Imp would never have acted alone.\" Ned rose and paced the length of the room. \"If the queen had a role in this or, gods forbid, the king himself... no, I will not believe that.\" Yet even as he said the words, he remembered that chill morning on the barrowlands, and Robert\'s talk of sending hired knives after the Targaryen princess. He remembered Rhaegar\'s infant son, the red ruin of his skull, and the way the king had turned away, as he had turned away in Darry\'s audience hall not so long ago. He could still hear Sansa pleading, as Lyanna had pleaded once. \"Most likely the king did not know,\" Littlefinger said. \"It would not be the first time. Our good Robert is practiced at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see.\" Ned had no reply for that. The face of the butcher\'s boy swam up before his eyes, cloven almost in two, and afterward the king had said not a word. His head was pounding. Littlefinger sauntered over to the table, wrenched the knife from the wood. \"The accusation is treason either way. Accuse the king and you will dance with Ilyn Payne before the words are out of your mouth. The queen... if you can find proof, and if you can make Robert listen, then perhaps... \"We have proof,\" Ned said. \"We have the dagger.\" \"This?\" Littlefinger flipped the knife casually end over end. \"A sweet piece of steel, but it cuts two ways, my lord. The Imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost or stolen while he was at Winterfell, and with his hireling dead, who is there to give him the lie?\" He tossed the knife lightly to Ned. \"My counsel is to drop that in the river and forget that it was ever forged.\" Ned regarded him coldly. \"Lord Baelish, I am a Stark of Winterfell. My son lies crippled, perhaps dying. He would be dead, and Catelyn with him, but for a wolf pup we found in the snow. If you truly believe I could forget that, you are as big a fool now as when you took up sword against my brother.\" \"A fool I may be, Stark... yet I\'m still here, while your brother has been moldering in his frozen grave for some fourteen years now. If you are so eager to molder beside him, far be it from me to dissuade you, but I would rather not be included in the party, thank you very much.\" \"You would be the last man I would willingly include in any party, Lord Baelish.\" \"You wound me deeply.\" Littlefinger placed a hand over his heart. \"For my part, I always found you Starks a tiresome lot, but Cat seems to have become attached to you, for reasons I cannot comprehend. I shall try to keep you alive for her sake. A fool\'s task, admittedly, but I could never refuse your wife anything.\" Littlefinger. \"I should warn you, Stark, we usually charge for that sort of thing around here.\" \"A moment alone, that\'s all I ask,\" Catelyn said. \"Very well.\" Littlefinger strolled to the door. \"Don\'t be too long. It is past time the Hand and I returned to the castle, before our absence is noted.\" Catelyn went to him and took his hands in her own. \"I will not forget the help you gave me, Petyr. When your men came for me, I did not know whether they were taking me to a friend or an enemy. I have found you more than a friend. I have found a brother I\'d thought lost.\" Petyr Baelish smiled. \"I am desperately sentimental, sweet lady. Best not tell anyone. I have spent years convincing the court that I am wicked and cruel, and I should hate to see all that hard work go for naught.\" Ned believed not a word of that, but he kept his voice polite as he said, \"You have my thanks as well, Lord Baelish.\" \"Oh, now there\'s a treasure,\" Littlefinger said, exiting. When the door had closed behind him, Ned turned back to his wife. \"Once you are home, send word to Helman Tallhart and Galbart Glover under my seal. They are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify Moat Cailin. Two hundred determined archers can hold the Neck against an army. Instruct Lord Manderly that he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at White Harbor, and see that they are well manned. And from this day on, I want a careful watch kept over Theon Greyjoy. If there is war, we shall have sore need of his father\'s fleet.\" \"War?\" The fear was plain on Catelyn\'s face. \"It will not come to that,\" Ned promised her, praying it was true. He took her in his arms again. \"The Lannisters are merciless in the face of weakness, as Aerys Targaryen learned to his sorrow, but they would not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind them, and that they shall not have. I must play out this fool\'s masquerade as if nothing is amiss. Remember why I came here, my love. If I find proof that the Lannisters murdered Jon Arryn... He felt Catelyn tremble in his arms. Her scarred hands clung to him. \"If,\" she said, \"what then, my love?\" That was the most dangerous part, Ned knew. \"All justice flows from the king,\" he told her. \"When I know the truth, I must go to Robert.\" And pray that he is the man I think he is, he finished silently, and not the man I fear he has become.');
INSERT INTO `books` VALUES ('ASOIAF','AGOT',21,'Tyrion III','Tyrion Lannister','Are you certain that you must leave us so soon?\" the Lord Commander asked him. \"Past certain, Lord Mormont,\" Tyrion replied. \"My brother Jaime will be wondering what has become of me. He may decide that you have convinced me to take the black.\" \"Would that I could.\" Mormont picked up a crab claw and cracked it in his fist. Old as he was, the Lord Commander still had the strength of a bear. \"You\'re a cunning man, Tyrion. We have need of men of your sort on the Wall.\" Tyrion grinned. \"Then I shall scour the Seven Kingdoms for dwarfs and ship them all to you, Lord Mormont.\" As they laughed, he sucked the meat from a crab leg and reached for another. The crabs had arrived from Eastwatch only this morning, packed in a barrel of snow, and they were succulent. Ser Alliser Thorne was the only man at table who did not so much as crack a smile. \"Lannister mocks us.\" \"Only you, Ser Alliser,\" Tyrion said. This time the laughter round the table had a nervous, uncertain quality to it. Thorne\'s black eyes fixed on Tyrion with loathing. \"You have a bold tongue for someone who is less than half a man. Perhaps you and I should visit the yard together.\" \"Why?\" asked Tyrion. \"The crabs are here.\" The remark brought more guffaws from the others. Ser Alliser stood up, his mouth a tight line. \"Come and make your japes with steel in your hand.\" Tyrion looked pointedly at his right hand. \"Why, I have steel in my hand, Ser Alliser, although it appears to be a crab fork. Shall we duel?\" He hopped up on his chair and began poking at Thorne\'s chest with the tiny fork. Roars of laughter filled the tower room. Bits of crab flew from the Lord Commander\'s mouth as he began to gasp and choke. Even his raven joined in, cawing loudly from above the window. \"Duel! Duel! Duel!\" Ser Alliser Thorne walked from the room so stiffly it looked as though he had a dagger up his butt. Mormont was still gasping for breath. Tyrion pounded him on the back. \"To the victor goes the spoils,\" he called out. \"I claim Thorne\'s share of the crabs.\" Finally the Lord Commander recovered himself. \"You are a wicked man, to provoke our Ser Alliser so,\" he scolded. Tyrion seated himself and took a sip of wine. \"If a man paints a target on his chest, he should expect that sooner or later someone will loose an arrow at him. I have seen dead men with more humor than your Ser Alliser.\" \"Not so,\" objected the Lord Steward, Bowen Marsh, a man as round and red as a pomegranate. \"You ought to hear the droll names he gives the lads he trains.\" Tyrion had heard a few of those droll names. \"I\'ll wager the lads have a few names for him as well,\" he said. \"Chip the ice off your eyes, my good lords. Ser Alliser Thorne should be mucking out your stables, not drilling your young warriors.\" \"The Watch has no shortage of stableboys,\" Lord Mormont grumbled. \"That seems to be all they send us these days. Stableboys and sneak thieves and rapers. Ser Alliser is an anointed knight, one of the few to take the black since I have been Lord Commander. He fought bravely at King\'s Landing.\" \"On the wrong side,\" Ser Jaremy Rykker commented dryly. \"I ought to know, I was there on the battlements beside him. Tywin Lannister gave us a splendid choice. Take the black, or see our heads on spikes before evenfall. No offense intended, Tyrion.\" \"None taken, Ser Jaremy. My father is very fond of spiked heads, especially those of people who have annoyed him in some fashion. And a face as noble as yours, well, no doubt he saw you decorating the city wall above the King\'s Gate. I think you would have looked very striking up there.\" \"Thank you,\" Ser Jaremy replied with a sardonic smile. Lord Commander Mormont cleared his throat. \"Sometimes I fear Ser Alliser saw you true, Tyrion. You do mock us and our noble purpose here.\" Tyrion shrugged. \"We all need to be mocked from time to time, Lord Mormont, lest we start to take ourselves too seriously. More wine, please.\" He held out his cup. As Rykker filled it for him, Bowen Marsh said, \"You have a great thirst for a small man.\" \"Oh, I think that Lord Tyrion is quite a large man,\" Maester Aemon said from the far end of the table. He spoke softly, yet the high officers of the Night\'s Watch all fell quiet, the better to hear what the ancient had to say. \"I think he is a giant come among us, here at the end of the world.\" Tyrion answered gently, \"I\'ve been called many things, my lord, but giant is seldom one of them.\" \"Nonetheless,\" Maester Aemon said as his clouded, milk-white eyes moved to Tyrion\'s face, \"I think it is true.\" For once, Tyrion Lannister found himself at a loss for words. He could only bow his head politely and say, \"You are too kind, Maester Aemon.\" The blind man smiled. He was a tiny thing, wrinkled and hairless, shrunken beneath the weight of a hundred years so his maester\'s collar with its links of many metals hung loose about his throat. \"I have been called many things, my lord,\" he said, \"but kind is seldom one of them.\" This time Tyrion himself led the laughter. Much later, when the serious business of eating was done and the others had left, Mormont offered Tyrion a chair beside the fire and a cup of mulled spirits so strong they brought tears to his eyes. \"The kingsroad can be perilous this far north,\" the Lord Commander told him as they drank. \"I have Jyck and Morrec,\" Tyrion said, \"and Yoren is riding south again.\" \"Yoren is only one man. The Watch shall escort you as far as Winterfell,\" Mormont announced in a tone that brooked no argument. \"Three men should be sufficient.\" \"If you insist, my lord,\" Tyrion said. \"You might send young Snow. He would be glad for a chance to see his brothers.\" Mormont frowned through his thick grey beard. \"Snow? Oh, the Stark bastard. I think not. The young ones need to forget the lives they left behind them, the brothers and mothers and all that. A visit home would only stir up feelings best left alone. I know these things. My own blood kin... my sister Maege rules Bear Island now, since my son\'s dishonor. I have nieces I have never seen.\" He took a swallow. \"Besides, Jon Snow is only a boy. You shall have three strong swords, to keep you safe.\" \"I am touched by your concern, Lord Mormont.\" The strong drink was making Tyrion light-headed, but not so drunk that he did not realize that the Old Bear wanted something from him. \"I hope I can repay your kindness.\" \"You can,\" Mormont said bluntly. \"Your sister sits beside the king. Your brother is a great knight, and your father the most powerful lord in the Seven Kingdoms. Speak to them for us. Tell them of our need here. You have seen for yourself, my lord. The Night\'s Watch is dying. Our strength is less than a thousand now. Six hundred here, two hundred in the Shadow Tower, even fewer at Eastwatch, and a scant third of those fighting men. The Wall is a hundred leagues long. Think on that. Should an attack come, I have three men to defend each mile of wall.\" \"Three and a third,\" Tyrion said with a yawn. Mormont scarcely seemed to hear him. The old man warmed his hands before the fire. \"I sent Benjen Stark to search after Yohn Royce\'s son, lost on his first ranging. The Royce boy was green as summer grass, yet he insisted on the honor of his own command, saying it was his due as a knight. I did not wish to offend his lord father, so I yielded. I sent him out with two men I deemed as good as any in the Watch. More fool.\" \"Fool,\" the raven agreed. Tyrion glanced up. The bird peered down at him with those beady black eyes, ruffling its wings. \"Fool,\" it called again. Doubtless old Mormont would take it amiss if he throttled the creature. A pity. The Lord Commander took no notice of the irritating bird. \"Gared was near as old as I am and longer on the Wall,\" he went on, \"yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled. I should never have believed it, not of him, but Lord Eddard sent me his head from Winterfell. Of Royce, there is no word. One deserter and two men lost, and now Ben Stark too has gone missing.\" He sighed deeply. \"Who am I to send searching after him? In two years I will be seventy. Too old and too weary for the burden I bear, yet if I set it down, who will pick it up? Alliser Thorne? Bowen Marsh? I would have to be as blind as Maester Aemon not to see what they are. The Night\'s Watch has become an army of sullen boys and tired old men. Apart from the men at my table tonight, I have perhaps twenty who can read, and even fewer who can think, or plan, or lead. Once the Watch spent its summers building, and each Lord Commander raised the Wall higher than he found it. Now it is all we can do to stay alive.\" He was in deadly earnest, Tyrion realized. He felt faintly embarrassed for the old man. Lord Mormont had spent a good part of his life on the Wall, and he needed to believe if those years were to have any meaning. \"I promise, the king will hear of your need,\" Tyrion said gravely, \"and I will speak to my father and my brother Jaime as well.\" And he would. Tyrion Lannister was as good as his word. He left the rest unsaid; that King Robert would ignore him, Lord Tywin would ask if he had taken leave of his senses, and Jaime would only laugh. \"You are a young man, Tyrion,\" Mormont said. \"How many winters have you seen?\" He shrugged. \"Eight, nine. I misremember.\" \"And all of them short.\" \"As you say, my lord.\" He had been born in the dead of winter, a terrible cruel one that the maesters said had lasted near three years, but Tyrion\'s earliest memories were of spring. \"When I was a boy, it was said that a long summer always meant a long winter to come. This summer has lasted nine years, Tyrion, and a tenth will soon be upon us. Think on that.\" \"When I was a boy,\" Tyrion replied, \"my wet nurse told me that one day, if men were good, the gods would give the world a summer without ending. Perhaps we\'ve been better than we thought, and the Great Summer is finally at hand.\" He grinned. The Lord Commander did not seem amused. \"You are not fool enough to believe that, my lord. Already the days grow shorter. There can be no mistake, Aemon has had letters from the Citadel, findings in accord with his own. The end of summer stares us in the face.\" Mormont reached out and clutched Tyrion tightly by the hand. \"You must make them understand. I tell you, my lord, the darkness is coming. There are wild things in the woods, direwolves and mammoths and snow bears the size of aurochs, and I have seen darker shapes in my dreams.\" \"In your dreams,\" Tyrion echoed, thinking how badly he needed another strong drink. Mormont was deaf to the edge in his voice. \"The fisherfolk near Eastwatch have glimpsed white walkers on the shore.\" This time Tyrion could not hold his tongue. \"The fisherfolk of Lannisport often glimpse merlings.\" \"Denys Mallister writes that the mountain people are moving south, slipping past the Shadow Tower in numbers greater than ever before. They are running, my lord... but running from what?\" Lord Mormont moved to the window and stared out into the night. \"These are old bones, Lannister, but they have never felt a chill like this. Tell the king what I say, I pray you. Winter is coming, and when the Long Night falls, only the Night\'s Watch will stand between the realm and the darkness that sweeps from the north. The gods help us all if we are not ready.\" \"The gods help me if I do not get some sleep tonight. Yoren is determined to ride at first light.\" Tyrion got to his feet, sleepy from wine and tired of doom. \"I thank you for all the courtesies you have done me, Lord Mormont.\" \"Tell them, Tyrion. Tell them and make them believe. That is all the thanks I need.\" He whistled, and his raven flew to him and perched on his shoulder. Mormont smiled and gave the bird some corn from his pocket, and that was how Tyrion left him. It was bitter cold outside. Bundled thickly in his furs, Tyrion Lannister pulled on his gloves and nodded to the poor frozen wretches standing sentry outside the Commander\'s Keep. He set off across the yard for his own chambers in the King\'s Tower, walking as briskly as his legs could manage. Patches of snow crunched beneath his feet as his boots broke the night\'s crust, and his breath steamed before him like a banner. He shoved his hands into his armpits and walked faster, praying that Morrec had remembered to warm his bed with hot bricks from the fire. Behind the King\'s Tower, the Wall glimmered in the light of the moon, immense and mysterious. Tyrion stopped for a moment to look up at it. His legs ached of cold and haste. Suddenly a strange madness took hold of him, a yearning to look once more off the end of the world. It would be his last chance, he thought; tomorrow he would ride south, and he could not imagine why he would ever want to return to this frozen desolation. The King\'s Tower was before him, with its promise of warmth and a soft bed, yet Tyrion found himself walking past it, toward the vast pale palisade of the Wall. A wooden stair ascended the south face, anchored on huge roughhewn beams sunk deep into the ice and frozen in place. Back and forth it switched, clawing its way upward as crooked as a bolt of lightning. The black brothers assured him that it was much stronger than it looked, but Tyrion\'s legs were cramping too badly for him to even contemplate the ascent. He went instead to the iron cage beside the well, clambered inside, and yanked hard on the bell rope, three quick pulls. He had to wait what seemed an eternity, standing there inside the bars with the Wall to his back. Long enough for Tyrion to begin to wonder why he was doing this. He had just about decided to forget his sudden whim and go to bed when the cage gave a jerk and began to ascend. He moved upward slowly, by fits and starts at first, then more smoothly. The ground fell away beneath him, the cage swung, and Tyrion wrapped his hands around the iron bars. He could feel the cold of the metal even through his gloves. Morrec had a fire burning in his room, he noted with approval, but the Lord Commander\'s tower was dark. The Old Bear had more sense than he did, it seemed. Then he was above the towers, still inching his way upward. Castle Black lay below him, etched in moonlight. You could see how stark and empty it was from up here; windowless keeps, crumbling walls, courtyards choked with broken stone. Farther off, he could see the lights of Mole\'s Town, the little village half a league south along the kingsroad, and here and there the bright glitter of moonlight on water where icy streams descended from the mountain heights to cut across the plains. The rest of the world was a bleak emptiness of windswept hills and rocky fields spotted with snow. Finally a thick voice behind him said, \"Seven hells, it\'s the dwarf,\" and the cage jerked to a sudden stop and hung there, swinging slowly back and forth, the ropes creaking. \"Bring him in, damn it.\" There was a grunt and a loud groaning of wood as the cage slid sideways and then the Wall was beneath him. Tyrion waited until the swinging had stopped before he pushed open the cage door and hopped down onto the ice. A heavy figure in black was leaning on the winch, while a second held the cage with a gloved hand. Their faces were muffled in woolen scarves so only their eyes showed, and they were plump with layers of wool and leather, black on black. \"And what will you be wanting, this time of night?\" the one by the winch asked. \"A last look.\" The men exchanged sour glances. \"Look all you want,\" the other one said. \"Just have a care you don\'t fall off, little man. The Old Bear would have our hides.\" A small wooden shack stood under the great crane, and Tyrion saw the dull glow of a brazier and felt a brief gust of warmth when the winch men opened the door and went back inside. And then he was alone. It was bitingly cold up here, and the wind pulled at his clothes like an insistent lover. The top of the Wall was wider than the kingsroad often was, so Tyrion had no fear of falling, although the footing was slicker than he would have liked. The brothers spread crushed stone across the walkways, but the weight of countless footsteps would melt the Wall beneath, so the ice would seem to grow around the gravel, swallowing it, until the path was bare again and it was time to crush more stone. Still, it was nothing that Tyrion could not manage. He looked off to the east and west, at the Wall stretching before him, a vast white road with no beginning and no end and a dark abyss on either side. West, he decided, for no special reason, and he began to walk that way, following the pathway nearest the north edge, where the gravel looked freshest. His bare cheeks were ruddy with the cold, and his legs complained more loudly with every step, but Tyrion ignored them. The wind swirled around him, gravel crunched beneath his boots, while ahead the white ribbon followed the lines of the hills, rising higher and higher, until it was lost beyond the western horizon. He passed a massive catapult, as tall as a city wall, its base sunk deep into the Wall. The throwing arm had been taken off for repairs and then forgotten; it lay there like a broken toy, half-embedded in the ice. On the far side of the catapult, a muffled voice called out a challenge. \"Who goes there? Halt!\" Tyrion stopped. \"If I halt too long I\'ll freeze in place, Jon,\" he said as a shaggy pale shape slid toward him silently and sniffed at his furs. \"Hello, Ghost.\" Jon Snow moved closer. He looked bigger and heavier in his layers of fur and leather, the hood of his cloak pulled down over his face. \"Lannister,\" he said, yanking loose the scarf to uncover his mouth. \"This is the last place I would have expected to see you.\" He carried a heavy spear tipped in iron, taller than he was, and a sword hung at his side in a leather sheath. Across his chest was a gleaming black warhorn, banded with silver. \"This is the last place I would have expected to be seen,\" Tyrion admitted. \"I was captured by a whim. If I touch Ghost, will he chew my hand off?\" \"Not with me here,\" Jon promised. Tyrion scratched the white wolf behind the ears. The red eyes watched him impassively. The beast came up as high as his chest now. Another year, and Tyrion had the gloomy feeling he\'d be looking up at him. \"What are you doing up here tonight?\" he asked. \"Besides freezing your manhood off...\" \"I have drawn night guard,\" Jon said. \"Again. Ser Alliser has kindly arranged for the watch commander to take a special interest in me. He seems to think that if they keep me awake half the night, I\'ll fall asleep during morning drill. So far I have disappointed him.\" Tyrion grinned. \"And has Ghost learned to juggle yet?\" \"No,\" said Jon, smiling, \"but Grenn held his own against Halder this morning, and Pyp is no longer dropping his sword quite so often as he did.\" \"Pyp?\" \"Pypar is his real name. The small boy with the large ears. He saw me working with Grenn and asked for help. Thorne had never even shown him the proper way to grip a sword.\" He turned to look north. \"I have a mile of Wall to guard. Will you walk with me?\" \"If you walk slowly,\" Tyrion said. \"The watch commander tells me I must walk, to keep my blood from freezing, but he never said how fast.\" They walked, with Ghost pacing along beside Jon like a white shadow. \"I leave on the morrow,\" Tyrion said. \"I know.\" Jon sounded strangely sad. \"I plan to stop at Winterfell on the way south. If there is any message that you would like me to deliver...\" \"Tell Robb that I\'m going to command the Night\'s Watch and keep him safe, so he might as well take up needlework with the girls and have Mikken melt down his sword for horseshoes.\" \"Your brother is bigger than me,\" Tyrion said with a laugh. \"I decline to deliver any message that might get me killed.\" \"Rickon will ask when I\'m coming home. Try to explain where I\'ve gone, if you can. Tell him he can have all my things while I\'m away, he\'ll like that.\" People seemed to be asking a great deal of him today, Tyrion Lannister thought. \"You could put all this in a letter, you know.\" \"Rickon can\'t read yet. Bran...\" He stopped suddenly. \"I don\'t know what message to send to Bran. Help him, Tyrion.\" \"What help could I give him? I am no maester, to ease his pain. I have no spells to give him back his legs.\" \"You gave me help when I needed it,\" Jon Snow said. \"I gave you nothing,\" Tyrion said. \"Words.\" \"Then give your words to Bran too.\" \"You\'re asking a lame man to teach a cripple how to dance,\" Tyrion said. \"However sincere the lesson, the result is likely to be grotesque. Still, I know what it is to love a brother, Lord Snow. I will give Bran whatever small help is in my power.\" \"Thank you, my lord of Lannister.\" He pulled off his glove and offered his bare hand. \"Friend.\" Tyrion found himself oddly touched. \"Most of my kin are bastards,\" he said with a wry smile, \"but you\'re the first I\'ve had to friend.\" He pulled a glove off with his teeth and clasped Snow by the hand, flesh against flesh. The boy\'s grip was firm and strong. When he had donned his glove again, Jon Snow turned abruptly and walked to the low, icy northern parapet. Beyond him the Wall fell away sharply; beyond him there was only the darkness and the wild. Tyrion followed him, and side by side they stood upon the edge of the world. The Night\'s Watch permitted the forest to come no closer than half a mile of the north face of the Wall. The thickets of ironwood and sentinel and oak that had once grown there had been harvested centuries ago, to create a broad swath of open ground through which no enemy could hope to pass unseen. Tyrion had heard that elsewhere along the Wall, between the three fortresses, the wildwood had come creeping back over the decades, that there were places where greygreen sentinels and pale white weirwoods had taken root in the shadow of the Wall itself, but Castle Black had a prodigious appetite for firewood, and here the forest was still kept at bay by the axes of the black brothers. It was never far, though. From up here Tyrion could see it, the dark trees looming beyond the stretch of open ground, like a second wall built parallel to the first, a wall of night. Few axes had ever swung in that black wood, where even the moonlight could not penetrate the ancient tangle of root and thorn and grasping limb. Out there the trees grew huge, and the rangers said they seemed to brood and knew not men. It was small wonder the Night\'s Watch named it the haunted forest. As he stood there and looked at all that darkness with no fires burning anywhere, with the wind blowing and the cold like a spear in his guts, Tyrion Lannister felt as though he could almost believe the talk of the Others, the enemy in the night. His jokes of grumkins and snarks no longer seemed quite so droll. \"My uncle is out there,\" Jon Snow said softly, leaning on his spear as he stared off into the darkness. \"The first night they sent me up here, I thought, Uncle Benjen will ride back tonight, and I\'ll see him first and blow the horn. He never came, though. Not that night and not any night.\" \"Give him time,\" Tyrion said. Far off to the north, a wolf began to howl. Another voice picked up the call, then another. Ghost cocked his head and listened. \"If he doesn\'t come back,\" Jon Snow promised, \"Ghost and I will go find him.\" He put his hand on the direwolf\'s head. \"I believe you,\" Tyrion said, but what he thought was, And who will go find you? He shivered.');

INSERT INTO `books` VALUES ('ASOIAF','ASOS',39,'Arya VII','Arya Stark','The man on the roof was the first to die. He was crouched down by the chimney two hundred yards away, no more than a vague shadow in the predawn gloom, but as the sky began to lighten he stirred, stretched, and stood. Anguy\'s arrow took him in the chest. He tumbled bonelessly down the steep slate pitch, and fell in front of the septry door. The Mummers had posted two guards there, but their torch left them night blind, and the outlaws had crept in close. Kyle and Notch let fly together. One man went down with an arrow through his throat, the other through his belly. The second man dropped the torch, and the flames licked up at him. He screamed as his clothes took fire, and that was the end of stealth. Thoros gave a shout, and the outlaws attacked in earnest. Arya watched from atop her horse, on the crest of the wooded ridge that overlooked the septry, mill, brewhouse, and stables and the desolation of weeds, burnt trees, and mud that surrounded them. The trees were mostly bare now, and the few withered brown leaves that still clung to the branches did little to obstruct her view. Lord Beric had left Beardless Dick and Mudge to guard them. Arya hated being left behind like she was some stupid child, but at least Gendry had been kept back as well. She knew better than to try and argue. This was battle, and in battle you had to obey. The eastern horizon glowed gold and pink, and overhead a half moon peeked out through low scuttling clouds. The wind blew cold, and Arya could hear the rush of water and the creak of the mill\'s great wooden waterwheel. There was a smell of rain in the dawn air, but no drops were falling yet. Flaming arrows flew through the morning mists, trailing pale ribbons of fire, and thudded into the wooden walls of the septry. A few smashed through shuttered windows, and soon enough thin tendrils of smoke were rising between the broken shutters. Two Mummers came bursting from the septry side by side, axes in their hands. Anguy and the other archers were waiting. One axeman died at once. The other managed to duck, so the shaft ripped through his shoulder. He staggered on, till two more arrows found him, so quickly it was hard to say which had struck first. The long shafts punched through his breastplate as if it had been made of silk instead of steel. He fell heavily. Anguy had arrows tipped with bodkins as well as broadheads. A bodkin could pierce even heavy plate. I\'m going to learn to shoot a bow, Arya thought. She loved sword fighting, but she could see how arrows were good too. Flames were creeping up the west wall of the septry, and thick smoke poured through a broken window. A Myrish crossbowman poked his head out a different window, got off a bolt, and ducked down to rewind. She could hear fighting from the stables as well, shouts well mingled with the screams of horses and the clang of steel. Kill them all, she thought fiercely. She bit her lip so hard she tasted blood. Kill every single one. The crossbowman appeared again, but no sooner had he loosed than three arrows hissed past his head. One rattled off his helm. He vanished, bow and all. Arya could see flames in several of the second-story windows. Between the smoke and the morning mists, the air was a haze of blowing black and white. Anguy and the other bowmen were creeping closer, the better to find targets. Then the septry erupted, the Mummers boiling out like angry ants. Two Ibbenese rushed through the door with shaggy brown shields held high before them, and behind them came a Dothraki with a great curved arakh and bells in his braid, and behind him three Volantene sellswords covered with fierce tattoos. Others were climbing out windows and leaping to the ground. Arya saw a man take an arrow through the chest with one leg across a windowsill, and heard his scream as he fell. The smoke was thickening. Quarrels and arrows sped back and forth. Watty fell with a grunt, his bow slipping from his hand. Kyle was trying to nock another shaft to his string when a man in black mail flung a spear through his belly. She heard Lord Beric shout. From out of the ditches and trees the rest of his band came pouring, steel in hand. Arya saw Lem\'s bright yellow cloak flapping behind him as he rode down the man who\'d killed Kyle. Thoros and Lord Beric were everywhere, their swords swirling fire. The red priest hacked at a hide shield until it flew to pieces, while his horse kicked the man in the face. A Dothraki screamed and charged the lightning lord, and the flaming sword leapt out to meet his arakh. The blades kissed and spun and kissed again. Then the Dothraki\'s hair was ablaze, and a moment later he was dead. She spied Ned too, fighting at the lightning lord\'s side. It\'s not fair, he\'s only a little older than me, they should have let me fight. The battle did not last very long. The Brave Companions still on their feet soon died, or threw down their swords. Two of the Dothraki managed to regain their horses and flee, but only because Lord Beric let them go. \"Let them carry the word back to Harrenhal,\" he said, with flaming sword in hand. \"It will give the Leech Lord and his goat a few more sleepless nights.\" Jack-Be-Lucky, Harwin, and Merrit o\' Moontown braved the burning septry to search for captives. They emerged from the smoke and flames a few moments later with eight brown brothers, one so weak that Merrit had to carry him across a shoulder. There was a septon with them as well, round-shouldered and balding, but he wore black chainmail over his grey robes. \"Found him hiding under the cellar steps,\" said Jack, coughing. Thoros smiled to see him. \"You are Utt.\" \"Septon Utt. A man of god.\" \"What god would want the likes o\' you?\" growled Lem. \"I have sinned,\" the septon wailed. \"I know, I know. Forgive me, Father. Oh, grievously have I sinned.\" Arya remembered Septon Utt from her time at Harrenhal. Shagwell the Fool said he always wept and prayed for forgiveness after he\'d killed his latest boy. Sometimes he even made the other Mummers scourge him. They all thought that was very funny. Lord Beric slammed his sword into its scabbard, quenching the flames. \"Give the dying the gift of mercy and bind the others hand and foot for trial,\" he commanded, and it was done. The trials went swiftly. Various of the outlaws came forward to tell of things the Brave Companions had done; towns and villages sacked, crops burned, women raped and murdered, men maimed and tortured. A few spoke of the boys that Septon Utt had carried off. The septon wept and prayed through it all. \"I am a weak reed,\" he told Lord Beric. \"I pray to the Warrior for strength, but the gods made me weak. Have mercy on my weakness. The boys, the sweet boys... I never mean to hurt them...\" Septon Utt soon dangled beneath a tall elm, swinging slowly by the neck, as naked as his name day. The other Brave Companions followed one by one. A few fought, kicking and struggling as the noose was tightened round their throats. One of the crossbowmen kept shouting, \"I soldier, I soldier,\" in a thick Myrish accent. Another offered to lead his captors to gold; a third told them what a good outlaw he would make. Each was stripped and bound and hanged in turn. Tom Sevenstrings played a dirge for them on his woodharp, and Thoros implored the Lord of Light to roast their souls until the end of time. A mummer tree, Arya thought as she watched them dangle, their pale skins painted a sullen red by the flames of the burning septry. Already the crows were coming, appearing out of nowhere. She heard them croaking and cackling at one another, and wondered what they were saying. Arya had not feared Septon Utt as much as she did Rorge and Biter and some of the others still at Harrenhal, but she was glad that he was dead all the same. They should have hanged the Hound too, or chopped his head off. Instead, to her disgust, the outlaws had treated Sandor Clegane\'s burned arm, restored his sword and horse and armor, and set him free a few miles from the hollow hill. All they\'d taken was his gold. The septry soon collapsed in a roar of smoke and flame, its walls no longer able to support the weight of its heavy slate roof. The eight brown brothers watched with resignation. They were all that remained, explained the eldest, who wore a small iron hammer on a thong about his neck to signify his devotion to the Smith. \"Before the war we were four-and-forty, and this was a prosperous place. We had a dozen milk cows and a bull, a hundred beehives, a vineyard and an apple arbor. But when the lions came through they took all our wine and milk and honey, slaughtered the cows, and put our vineyard to the torch. After that... I have lost count of our visitors. This false septon was only the latest. There was one monster... we gave him all our silver, but he was certain we were hiding gold, so his men killed us one by one to make Elder Brother talk.\" \"How did the eight of you survive?\" asked Anguy the Archer. \"I am ashamed,\" the old man said. \"It was me. When it came my turn to die, I told them where our gold was hidden.\" \"Brother,\" said Thoros of Myr, \"the only shame was not telling them at once.\" The outlaws sheltered that night in the brewhouse beside the little river. Their hosts had a cache of food hidden beneath the floor of the stables, so they shared a simple supper; oaten bread, onions, and a watery cabbage soup tasting faintly of garlic. Arya found a slice of carrot floating in her bowl, and counted herself lucky. The brothers never asked the outlaws for names. They know, Arya thought. How could they not? Lord Beric wore the lightning bolt on breastplate, shield, and cloak, and Thoros his red robes, or what remained of them. One brother, a young novice, was bold enough to tell the red priest not to pray to his false god so long as he was under their roof. \"Bugger that,\" said Lem Lemoncloak. \"He\'s our god too, and you owe us for your bloody lives. And what\'s false about him? Might be your Smith can mend a broken sword, but can he heal a broken man?\" \"Enough, Lem,\" Lord Beric commanded. \"Beneath their roof we will honor their rules.\" \"The sun will not cease to shine if we miss a prayer or two,\" Thoros agreed mildly. \"I am one who would know.\" Lord Beric himself did not eat. Arya had never seen him eat, though from time to time he took a cup of wine. He did not seem to sleep, either. His good eye would often close, as if from weariness, but when you spoke to him it would flick open again at once. The Marcher lord was still clad in his ratty black cloak and dented breastplate with its chipped enamel lightning. He even slept in that breastplate. The dull black steel hid the terrible wound the Hound had given him, the same way his thick woolen scarf concealed the dark ring about his throat. But nothing hid his broken head, all caved in at the temple, or the raw red pit that was his missing eye, or the shape of the skull beneath his face. Arya looked at him warily, remembering all the tales told of him in Harrenhal. Lord Beric seemed to sense her fear. He turned his head, and beckoned her closer. \"Do I frighten you, child?\" \"No.\" She chewed her lip. \"Only... well... I thought the Hound had killed you, but...\" \"A wound,\" said Lem Lemoncloak. \"A grievous wound, aye, but Thoros healed it. There\'s never been no better healer.\" Lord Beric gazed at Lem with a queer look in his good eye and no look at all in the other, only scars and dried blood. \"No better healer,\" he agreed wearily. \"Lem, past time to change the watch, I\'d think. See to it, if you\'d be so good.\" \"Aye, m\'lord.\" Lem\'s big yellow cloak swirled behind him as he strode out into the windy night. \"Even brave men blind themselves sometimes, when they are afraid to see,\" Lord Beric said when Lem was gone. \"Thoros, how many times have you brought me back now?\" The red priest bowed his head. \"It is R\'hllor who brings you back, my lord. The Lord of Light. I am only his instrument.\" \"How many times?\" Lord Beric insisted. \"Six,\" Thoros said reluctantly. \"And each time is harder. You have grown reckless, my lord. Is death so very sweet?\" \"Sweet? No, my friend. Not sweet.\" \"Then do not court it so. Lord Tywin leads from the rear. Lord Stannis as well. You would be wise to do the same. A seventh death might mean the end of both of us.\" Lord Beric touched the spot above his left ear where his temple was caved in. \"Here is where Ser Burton Crakehall broke helm and head with a blow of his mace.\" He unwound his scarf, exposing the black bruise that encircled his neck. \"Here the mark the manticore made at Rushing Falls. He seized a poor beekeeper and his wife, thinking they were mine, and let it be known far and wide that he would hang them both unless I gave myself up to him. When I did he hanged them anyway, and me on the gibbet between them.\" He lifted a finger to the raw red pit of his eye. \"Here is where the Mountain thrust his dirk through my visor.\" A weary smile brushed his lips. \"That\'s thrice I have died at the hands of House Clegane. You would think that I might have learned...\" It was a jest, Arya knew, but Thoros did not laugh. He put a hand on Lord Beric\'s shoulder. \"Best not to dwell on it.\" \"Can I dwell on what I scarce remember? I held a castle on the Marches once, and there was a woman I was pledged to marry, but I could not find that castle today, nor tell you the color of that woman\'s hair. Who knighted me, old friend? What were my favorite foods? It all fades. Sometimes I think I was born on the bloody grass in that grove of ash, with the taste of fire in my mouth and a hole in my chest. Are you my mother, Thoros?\" Arya stared at the Myrish priest, all shaggy hair and pink rags and bits of old armor. Grey stubble covered his cheeks and the sagging skin beneath his chin. He did not look much like the wizards in Old Nan\'s stories, but even so... \"Could you bring back a man without a head?\" Arya asked. \"Just the once, not six times. Could you?\" \"I have no magic, child. Only prayers. That first time, his lordship had a hole right through him and blood in his mouth, I knew there was no hope. So when his poor torn chest stopped moving, I gave him the good god\'s own kiss to send him on his way. I filled my mouth with fire and breathed the flames inside him, down his throat to lungs and heart and soul. The last kiss it is called, and many a time I saw the old priests bestow it on the Lord\'s servants as they died. I had given it a time or two myself, as all priests must. But never before had I felt a dead man shudder as the fire filled him, nor seen his eyes come open. It was not me who raised him, my lady. It was the Lord. R\'hllor is not done with him yet. Life is warmth, and warmth is fire, and fire is God\'s and God\'s alone.\" Arya felt tears well in her eyes. Thoros used a lot of words, but all they meant was no, that much she understood. \"Your father was a good man,\" Lord Beric said. \"Harwin has told me much of him. For his sake, I would gladly forgo your ransom, but we need the gold too desperately.\" She chewed her lip. That\'s true, I guess. He had given the Hound\'s gold to Greenbeard and the Huntsman to buy provisions south of the Mander, she knew. \"The last harvest burned, this one is drowning, and winter will soon be on us,\" she had heard him say when he sent them off. \"The smallfolk need grain and seed, and we need blades and horses. Too many of my men ride rounseys, drays, and mules against foes mounted on coursers and destriers.\" Arya didn\'t know how much Robb would pay for her, though. He was a king now, not the boy she\'d left at Winterfell with snow melting in his hair. And if he knew the things she\'d done, the stableboy and the guard at Harrenhal and all \"What if my brother doesn\'t want to ransom me?\" \"Why would you think that?\" asked Lord Beric. \"Well,\" Arya said, \"my hair\'s messy and my nails are dirty and my feet are all hard.\" Robb wouldn\'t care about that, probably, but her mother would. Lady Catelyn always wanted her to be like Sansa, to sing and dance and sew and mind her courtesies. Just thinking of it made Arya try to comb her hair with her fingers, but it was all tangles and mats, and all she did was tear some out. \"I ruined that gown that Lady Smallwood gave me, and I don\'t sew so good.\" She chewed her lip. \"I don\'t sew very well, I mean. Septa Mordane used to say I had a blacksmith\'s hands.\" Gendry hooted. \"Those soft little things?\" he called out. \"You couldn\'t even hold a hammer.\" \"I could if I wanted!\" she snapped at him. Thoros chuckled. \"Your brother will pay, child. Have no fear on that count.\" \"Yes, but what if he won\'t?\" she insisted. Lord Beric sighed. \"Then I will send you to Lady Smallwood for a time, or perhaps to mine own castle of Blackhaven. But that will not be necessary, I\'m certain. I do not have the power to give you back your father, no more than Thoros does, but I can at least see that you are returned safely to your mother\'s arms.\" \"Do you swear?\" she asked him. Yoren had promised to take her home too, only he\'d gotten killed instead. \"On my honor as a knight,\" the lightning lord said solemnly. It was raining when Lem returned to the brewhouse, muttering curses as water ran off his yellow cloak to puddle on the floor. Anguy and Jack-Be-Lucky sat by the door rolling dice, but no matter which game they played one-eyed Jack had no luck at all. Tom Sevenstrings replaced a string on his woodharp, and sang \"The Mother\'s Tears, \"\"When Willum\'s Wife Was Wet, \"\"Lord Harte Rode Out on a Rainy Day,\" and then \"The Rains of Castamere.\" And who are you, the proud lord said, that I must bow so low? Only a cat of a different coat, that\'s all the truth I know In a coat of gold or a coat of red, a lion still has claws, And mine are long and sharp, my lord, as long and sharp as yours. And so he spoke, and so he spoke, that lord of Castamere, But now the rains weep o\'er his hall, with no one there to hear. Yes now the rains weep o\'er his hall, and not a soul to hear. Finally Tom ran out of rain songs and put away his harp. Then there was only the sound of the rain itself beating down on the slate roof of the brewhouse. The dice game ended, and Arya stood on one leg and then the other listening to Merrit complain about his horse throwing a shoe. \"I could shoe him for you,\" said Gendry, all of a sudden. \"I was only a \'prentice, but my master said my hand was made to hold a hammer. I can shoe horses, close up rents in mail, and beat the dents from plate. I bet I could make swords too.\" \"What are you saying, lad?\" asked Harwin. \"I\'ll smith for you.\" Gendry went to one knee before Lord Beric. \"If you\'ll have me, m\'lord, I could be of use. I\'ve made tools and knives and once I made a helmet that wasn\'t so bad. One of the Mountain\'s men stole it from me when we was taken.\" Arya bit her lip. He means to leave me too. \"You would do better serving Lord Tully at Riverrun,\" said Lord Beric. \"I cannot pay for your work.\" \"No one ever did. I want a forge, and food to eat, some place I can sleep. That\'s enough, m\'lord.\" \"A smith can find a welcome most anywhere. A skilled armorer even more so. Why would you choose to stay with us?\" Arya watched Gendry screw up his stupid face, thinking. \"At the hollow hill, what you said about being King Robert\'s men, and brothers, I liked that. I liked that you gave the Hound a trial. Lord Bolton just hanged folk or took off their heads, and Lord Tywin and Ser Amory were the same. I\'d sooner smith for you.\" \"We got plenty of mail needs mending, m\'lord,\" Jack reminded Lord Beric. \"Most we took off the dead, and there\'s holes where the death came through.\" \"You must be a lackwit, boy,\" said Lem. \"We\'re outlaws. Lowborn scum, most of us, excepting his lordship. Don\'t think it\'ll be like Tom\'s fool songs neither. You won\'t be stealing no kisses from a princess, nor riding in no tourneys in stolen armor. You join us, you\'ll end with your neck in a noose, or your head mounted up above some castle gate.\" \"It\'s no more than they\'d do for you,\" said Gendry. \"Aye, that\'s so,\" said Jack-Be-Lucky cheerfully. \"The crows await us all * M\'lord, the boy seems brave enough, and we do have need of what he brings us. Take him, says Jack.\" \"And quick,\" suggested Harwin, chuckling, \"before the fever passes and he comes back to his senses.\" A wan smile crossed Lord Beric\'s lips. \"Thoros, my sword.\" This time the lightning lord did not set the blade afire, but merely laid it light on Gendry\'s shoulder. \"Gendry, do you swear before the eyes of gods and men to defend those who cannot defend themselves, to protect all women and children, to obey your captains, your liege lord, and your king, to fight bravely when needed and do such other tasks as are laid upon you, however hard or humble or dangerous they may be?\" \"I do, m\'lord.\" The marcher lord moved the sword from the right shoulder to the left, and said, \"Arise Ser Gendry, knight of the hollow hill, and be welcome to our brotherhood.\" From the door came rough, rasping laughter. The rain was running off him. His burned arm was wrapped in leaves and linen and bound tight against his chest by a crude rope sling, but the older burns that marked his face glistened black and slick in the glow of their little fire. \"Making more knights, Dondarrion?\" the intruder said in a growl. \"I ought to kill you all over again for that.\" Lord Beric faced him coolly. \"I\'d hoped we\'d seen the last of you, Clegane. How did you come to find us?\" \"It wasn\'t hard. You made enough bloody smoke to be seen in Oldtown.\" \"What\'s become of the sentries I posted?\" Clegane\'s mouth twitched. \"Those two blind men? Might be I killed them both. What would you do if I had?\" Anguy strung his bow. Notch was doing the same. \"Do you wish to die so very much, Sandor?\" asked Thoros. \"You must be mad or drunk to follow us here.\" \"Drunk on rain? You didn\'t leave me enough gold to buy a cup of wine, you whoresons.\" Anguy drew an arrow. \"We\'re outlaws. Outlaws steal. It\'s in the songs, if you ask nice Tom may sing you one. Be thankful we didn\'t kill you.\" \"Come try it, Archer. I\'ll take that quiver off you and shove those arrows up your freckly little arse.\" Anguy raised his longbow, but Lord Beric lifted a hand before he could loose. \"Why did you come here, Clegane?\" \"To get back what\'s mine.\" \"Your gold?\" \"What else? It wasn\'t for the pleasure of looking at your face, Dondarrion, I\'ll tell you that. You\'re uglier than me now. And a robber knight besides, it seems.\" \"I gave you a note for your gold,\" Lord Beric said calmly. \"A promise to pay, when the war\'s done.\" \"I wiped my arse with your paper. I want the gold.\" \"We don\'t have it. I sent it south with Greenbeard and the Huntsman, to buy grain and seed across the Mander.\" \"To feed all them whose crops you burned,\" said Gendry. \"Is that the tale, now?\" Sandor Clegane laughed again. \"As it happens, that\'s just what I meant to do with it. Feed a bunch of ugly peasants and their poxy whelps.\" \"You\'re lying,\" said Gendry. \"The boy has a mouth on him, I see. Why believe them and not me? Couldn\'t be my face, could it?\" Clegane glanced at Arya. \"You going to make her a knight too, Dondarrion? The first eight-year-old girl knight?\" \"I\'m twelve,\" Arya lied loudly, \"and I could be a knight if I wanted. I could have killed you too, only Lem took my knife.\" Remembering that still made her angry. \"Complain to Lem, not me. Then tuck your tail between your legs and run. Do you know what dogs do to wolves?\" \"Next time I will kill you. I\'ll kill your brother too!\" \"No.\" His dark eyes narrowed. \"That you won\'t.\" He turned back to Lord Beric. \"Say, make my horse a knight. He never shits in the hall and doesn\'t kick more than most, he deserves to be knighted. Unless you meant to steal him too.\" \"Best climb on that horse and go,\" warned Lem. \"I\'ll go with my gold. Your own god said I\'m guiltless - \"The Lord of Light gave you back your life,\" declared Thoros of Myr. \"He did not proclaim you Baelor the Blessed come again.\" The red priest unsheathed his sword, and Arya saw that Jack and Merrit had drawn as well. Lord Beric still held the blade he\'d used to dub Gendry. Maybe this time they\'ll kill him. The Hound\'s mouth gave another twitch. \"You\'re no more than common thieves.\" Lem glowered. \"Your lion friends ride into some village, take all the food and every coin they find, and call it foraging. The wolves as well, so why not us? No one robbed you, dog. You just been good and foraged.\" Sandor Clegane looked at their faces, every one, as if he were trying to commit them all to memory. Then he walked back out into the darkness and the pouring rain from whence he\'d come, with never another word. The outlaws waited, wondering... \"I best go see what he did to our sentries.\" Harwin took a wary look out the door before he left, to make certain the Hound was not lurking just outside. \"How\'d that bloody bastard get all that gold anyhow?\" Lem Lemoncloak said, to break the tension. Anguy shrugged. \"He won the Hand\'s tourney. In King\'s Landing.\" The bowman grinned. \"I won a fair fortune myself, but then I met Dancy, Jayde, and Alayaya. They taught me what roast swan tastes like, and how to bathe in Arbor wine.\" \"Pissed it all away, did you?\" laughed Harwin. \"Not all. I bought these boots, and this excellent dagger.\" \"You ought t\'have bought some land and made one o\' them roast swan girls an honest woman,\" said Jack-Be-Lucky. \"Raised yourself a crop o\' turnips and a crop o\' sons.\" \"Warrior defend me! What a waste that would have been, to turn my gold to turnips.\" \"I like turnips,\" said Jack, aggrieved. \"I could do with some mashed turnips right now.\" Thoros of Myr paid no heed to the banter. \"The Hound has lost more than a few bags of coin,\" he mused. \"He has lost his master and kennel as well. He cannot go back to the Lannisters, the Young Wolf would never have him, nor would his brother be like to welcome him. That gold was all he had left, it seems to me.\" \"Bloody hell,\" said Watty the Miller. \"He\'ll come murder us in our sleep for sure, then.\" \"No.\" Lord Beric had sheathed his sword. \"Sandor Clegane would kill us all gladly, but not in our sleep. Anguy, on the morrow, take the rear with Beardless Dick. If you see Clegane still sniffing after us, kill his horse.\" \"That\'s a good horse,\" Anguy protested. \"Aye,\" said Lem. \"It\'s the bloody rider we should be killing. We could use that horse.\" \"I\'m with Lem,\" Notch said. \"Let me feather the dog a few times, discourage him some.\" Lord Beric shook his head. \"Clegane won his life beneath the hollow hill. I will not rob him of it.\" \"My lord is wise,\" Thoros told the others. \"Brothers, a trial by battle is a holy thing. You heard me ask R\'hllor to take a hand, and you saw his fiery finger snap Lord Beric\'s sword, just as he was about to make an end of it. The Lord of Light is not yet done with Joffrey\'s Hound, it would seem.\" Harwin soon returned to the brewhouse. \"Puddingfoot was sound asleep, but unharmed.\" \"Wait till I get hold of him,\" said Lem. \"I\'ll cut him a new bunghole. He could have gotten every one of us killed.\" No one rested very comfortably that night, knowing that Sandor Clegane was out there in the dark, somewhere close. Arya curled up near the fire, warm and snug, yet sleep would not come. She took out the coin that Jaqen H\'ghar had given her and curled her fingers around it as she lay beneath her cloak. It made her feel strong to hold it, remembering how she\'d been the ghost in Harrenhal. She could kill with a whisper then. Jaqen was gone, though. He\'d left her. Hot Pie left me too, and now Gendry is leaving. Lommy had died, Yoren had died, Syrio Forel had died, even her father had died, and Jaqen had given her a stupid iron penny and vanished. \"Valar morghulis,\" she whispered softly, tightening her fist so the hard edges of the coin dug into her palm. \"Ser Gregor, Dunsen, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling. The Tickler and the Hound. Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei.\" Arya tried to imagine how they would look when they were dead, but it was hard to bring their faces to mind. The Hound she could see, and his brother the Mountain, and she would never forget Joffrey\'s face, or his mother\'s... but Raff and Dunsen and Polliver were all fading, and even the Tickler, whose looks had been so commonplace. Sleep took her at last, but in the black of night Arya woke again, tingling. The fire had burned down to embers. Mudge stood by the door, and another guard was pacing outside. The rain had stopped, and she could hear wolves howling. So close, she thought, and so many. They sounded as if they were all around the stable, dozens of them, maybe hundreds. I hope they eat the Hound. She remembered what he\'d said, about wolves and dogs. Come morning, Septon Utt still swung beneath the tree, but the brown brothers were out in the rain with spades, digging shallow graves for the other dead. Lord Beric thanked them for the night\'s lodging and the meal, and gave them a bag of silver stags to help rebuild. Harwin, Likely Luke, and Watty the Miller went out scouting, but neither wolves nor hounds were found. As Arya was cinching her saddle girth, Gendry came up to say that he was sorry. She put a foot in the stirrup and swung up into her saddle, so she could look down on him instead of up. You could have made swords at Riverrun for my brother, she thought, but what she said was, \"If you want to be some stupid outlaw knight and get hanged, why should I care? I\'ll be at Riverrun, ransomed, with my brother.\" There was no rain that day, thankfully, and for once they made good time.');
INSERT INTO `books` VALUES ('ASOIAF','ASOS',40,'Bran III','Bran Stark','The tower stood upon an island, its twin reflected on the still blue waters. When the wind blew, ripples moved across the surface of the lake, chasing one another like boys at play. Oak trees grew thick along the lakeshore, a dense stand of them with a litter of fallen acorns on the ground beneath. Beyond them was the village, or what remained of it. It was the first village they had seen since leaving the foothills. Meera had scouted ahead to make certain there was no one lurking amongst the ruins. Sliding in and amongst oaks and apple trees with her net and spear in hand, she startled three red deer and sent them bounding away through the brush. Summer saw the flash of motion and was after them at once. Bran watched the direwolf lope off, and for a moment wanted nothing so much as to slip his skin and run with him, but Meera was waving for them to come ahead. Reluctantly, he turned away from Summer and urged Hodor on, into the village. Jojen walked with them. The ground from here to the Wall was grasslands, Bran knew; fallow fields and low rolling hills, high meadows and lowland bogs. It would be much easier going than the mountains behind, but so much open space made Meera uneasy. \"I feel naked,\" she confessed. \"There\'s no place to hide.\" \"Who holds this land?\" Jojen asked Bran. \"The Night\'s Watch,\" he answered. \"This is the Gift. The New Gift, and north of that Brandon\'s Gift.\" Maester Luwin had taught him the history. \"Brandon the Builder gave all the land south of the Wall to the black brothers, to a distance of twenty-five leagues. For their... for their sustenance and support.\" He was proud that he still remembered that part. \"Some maesters say it was some other Brandon, not the Builder, but it\'s still Brandon\'s Gift. Thousands of years later, Good Queen Alysanne visited the Wall on her dragon Silverwing, and she thought the Night\'s Watch was so brave that she had the Old King double the size of their lands, to fifty leagues. So that was the New Gift.\" He waved a hand. \"Here. All this.\" No one had lived in the village for long years, Bran could see. All the houses were falling down. Even the inn. It had never been much of an inn, to look at it, but now all that remained was a stone chimney and two cracked walls, set amongst a dozen apple trees. One was growing up through the common room, where a layer of wet brown leaves and rotting apples carpeted the floor. The air was thick with the smell of them, a cloying cidery scent that was almost overwhelming. Meera stabbed a few apples with her frog spear, trying to find some still good enough to eat, but they were all too brown and wormy. It was a peaceful spot, still and tranquil and lovely to behold, but Bran thought there was something sad about an empty inn, and Hodor seemed to feel it too. \"Hodor?\" he said in a confused sort of way. \"Hodor? Hodor?\" \"This is good land.\" Jojen picked up a handful of dirt, rubbing it between his fingers. \"A village, an inn, a stout holdfast in the lake, all these apple trees... but where are the people, Bran? Why would they leave such a place?\" \"They were afraid of the wildlings,\" said Bran. \"Wildlings come over the Wall or through the mountains, to raid and steal and carry off women. If they catch you, they make your skull into a cup to drink blood, Old Nan used to say. The Night\'s Watch isn\'t so strong as it was in Brandon\'s day or Queen Alysanne\'s, so more get through. The places nearest the Wall got raided so much the smallfolk moved south, into the mountains or onto the Umber lands east of the kingsroad. The Greatjon\'s people get raided too, but not so much as the people who used to live in the Gift.\" Jojen Reed turned his head slowly, listening to music only he could hear. \"We need to shelter here. There\'s a storm coming. A bad one.\" Bran looked up at the sky. It had been a beautiful crisp clear autumn day, sunny and almost warm, but there were dark clouds off to the west now, that was true, and the wind seemed to be picking up. \"There\'s no roof on the inn and only the two walls,\" he pointed out. \"We should go out to the holdfast.\" \"Hodor,\" said Hodor. Maybe he agreed. \"We have no boat, Bran.\" Meera poked through the leaves idly with her frog spear. \"There\'s a causeway. A stone causeway, hidden under the water. We could walk out.\" They could, anyway; he would have to ride on Hodor\'s back, but at least he\'d stay dry that way. The Reeds exchanged a look. \"How do you know that?\" asked Jojen. \"Have you been here before, my prince?\" \"No. Old Nan told me. The holdfast has a golden crown, see?\" He pointed across the lake. You could see patches of flaking gold paint up around the crenellations. \"Queen Alysanne slept there, so they painted the merlons gold in her honor.\" \"A causeway?\" Jojen studied the lake. \"You are certain?\" \"Certain,\" said Bran. Meera found the foot of it easily enough, once she knew to look; a stone pathway three feet wide, leading right out into the lake. She took them out step by careful step, probing ahead with her frog spear. They could see where the path emerged again, climbing from the water onto the island and turning into a short flight of stone steps that led to the holdfast door. Path, steps, and door were in a straight line, which made you think the causeway ran straight, but that wasn\'t so. Under the lake it zigged and zagged, going a third of a way around the island before jagging back. The turns were treacherous, and the long path meant that anyone approaching would be exposed to arrow fire from the tower for a long time. The hidden stones were slimy and slippery too; twice Hodor almost lost his footing and shouted \"HODOR!\" in alarm before regaining his balance. The second time scared Bran badly. If Hodor fell into the lake with him in his basket, he could well drown, especially if the huge stableboy panicked and forgot that Bran was there, the way he did sometimes. Maybe we should have stayed at the inn, under the apple tree, he thought, but by then it was too late. Thankfully there was no third time, and the water never got up past Hodor\'s waist, though the Reeds were in it up to their chests. And before long they were on the island, climbing the steps to the holdfast. The door was still stout, though its heavy oak planks had warped over the years and it could no longer be closed completely. Meera shoved it open all the way, the rusted iron hinges screaming. The lintel was low. \"Duck down, Hodor,\" Bran said, and he did, but not enough to keep Bran from hitting his head. \"That hurt,\" he complained. \"Hodor,\" said Hodor, straightening. They found themselves in a gloomy strongroom, barely large enough to hold the four of them. Steps built into the inner wall of the tower curved away upward to their left, downward to their right, behind iron grates. Bran looked up and saw another grate just above his head. A murder hole. He was glad there was no one up there now to pour boiling oil down on them. The grates were locked, but the iron bars were red with rust. Hodor grabbed hold of the lefthand door and gave it a pull, grunting with effort. Nothing happened. He tried pushing with no more success. He shook the bars, kicked, shoved against them and rattled them and punched the hinges with a huge hand until the air was filled with flakes of rust, but the iron door would not budge. The one down to the undervault was no more accommodating. \"No way in,\" said Meera, shrugging. The murder hole was just above Bran\'s head, as he sat in his basket on Hodor\'s back. He reached up and grabbed the bars to give them a try. When he pulled down the grating came out of the ceiling in a cascade of rust and crumbling stone. \"HODOR!\" Hodor shouted. The heavy iron grate gave Bran another bang in the head, and crashed down near Jojen\'s feet when he shoved it off of him. Meera laughed. \"Look at that, my prince,\" she said, \"you\'re stronger than Hodor.\" Bran blushed. With the grate gone, Hodor was able to boost Meera and Jojen up through the gaping murder hole. The crannogmen took Bran by the arms and drew him up after them. Getting Hodor inside was the hard part. He was too heavy for the Reeds to lift the way they\'d lifted Bran. Finally Bran told him to go look for some big rocks. The island had no lack of those, and Hodor was able to pile them high enough to grab the crumbling edges of the hole and climb through. \"Hodor,\" he panted happily, grinning at all of them. They found themselves in a maze of small cells, dark and empty, but Meera explored until she found the way back to the steps. The higher they climbed, the better the light; on the third story the thick outer wall was pierced by arrow slits, the fourth had actual windows, and the fifth and highest was one big round chamber with arched doors on three sides opening onto small stone balconies. On the fourth side was a privy chamber perched above a sewer chute that dropped straight down into the lake. By the time they reached the roof the sky was completely overcast, and the clouds to the west were black. The wind was blowing so strong it lifted up Bran\'s cloak and made it flap and snap. \"Hodor,\" Hodor said at the noise. Meera spun in a circle. \"I feel almost a giant, standing high above the world.\" \"There are trees in the Neck that stand twice as tall as this,\" her brother reminded her. \"Aye, but they have other trees around them just as high,\" said Meera. \"The world presses close in the Neck, and the sky is so much smaller. Here... feel that wind, Brother? And look how large the world has grown.\" It was true, you could see a long ways from up here. To the south the foothills rose, with the mountains grey and green beyond them. The rolling plains of the New Gift stretched away to all the other directions, as far as the eye could see. \"I was hoping we could see the Wall from here,\" said Bran, disappointed. \"That was stupid, we must still be fifty leagues away.\" just speaking of it made him feel tired, and cold as well. \"Jojen, what will we do when we reach the Wall? My uncle always said how big it was. Seven hundred feet high, and so thick at the base that the gates are more like tunnels through the ice. How are we going to get past to find the three-eyed crow?\" \"There are abandoned castles along the Wall, I\'ve heard,\" Jojen answered. \"Fortresses built by the Night\'s Watch but now left empty. One of them may give us our way through.\" The ghost castles, Old Nan had called them. Maester Luwin had once made Bran learn the names of every one of the forts along the Wall. That had been hard; there were nineteen of them all told, though no more than seventeen had ever been manned at any one time. At the feast in honor of King Robert\'s visit to Winterfell, Bran had recited the names for his uncle Benjen, east to west and then west to east. Benjen Stark had laughed and said, \"You know them better than I do, Bran. Perhaps you should be First Ranger. I\'ll stay here in your place.\" That was before Bran fell, though. Before he was broken. By the time he\'d woken crippled from his sleep, his uncle had gone back to Castle Black. \"My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone whenever a castle had to be abandoned,\" said Bran. \"Then we\'ll have to open them again,\" said Meera. That made him uneasy. \"We shouldn\'t do that. Bad things might come through from the other side. We should just go to Castle Black and tell the Lord Commander to let us pass.\" \"Your Grace,\" said Jojen, \"we must avoid Castle Black, just as we avoided the kingsroad. There are hundreds of men there.\" \"Men of the Night\'s Watch,\" said Bran. \"They say vows, to take no part in wars and stuff.\" \"Aye,\" said Jojen, \"but one man willing to forswear himself would be enough to sell your secret to the ironmen or the Bastard of Bolton. And we cannot be certain that the Watch would agree to let us pass. They might decide to hold us or send us back.\" \"But my father was a friend of the Night\'s Watch, and my uncle is First Ranger. He might know where the three-eyed crow lives. And Jon\'s at Castle Black too.\" Bran had been hoping to see Jon again, and their uncle too. The last black brothers to visit Winterfell said that Benjen Stark had vanished on a ranging, but surely he would have made his way back by now. \"I bet the Watch would even give us horses,\" he went on. \"Quiet.\" Jojen shaded his eyes with a hand and gazed off toward the setting sun. \"Look. There\'s something... a rider, I think. Do you see him?\" Bran shaded his eyes as well, and even so he had to squint. He saw nothing at first, till some movement made him turn. At first he thought it might be Summer, but no. A man on a horse. He was too far away to see much else. \"Hodor?\" Hodor had put a hand over his eyes as well, only he was looking the wrong way. \"Hodor?\" \"He is in no haste,\" said Meera, \"but he\'s making for this village, it seems to me.\" \"We had best go inside, before we\'re seen,\" said Jojen. \"Summer\'s near the village,\" Bran objected. \"Summer will be fine,\" Meera promised. \"It\'s only one man on a tired horse.\" A few fat wet drops began to patter against the stone as they retreated to the floor below. That was well timed; the rain began to fall in earnest a short time later. Even through the thick walls they could hear it lashing against the surface of the lake. They sat on the floor in the round empty room, amidst gathering gloom. The north-facing balcony looked out toward the abandoned village. Meera crept out on her belly to peer across the lake and see what had become of the horseman. \"He\'s taken shelter in the ruins of the inn,\" she told them when she came back. \"it looks as though he\'s making a fire in the hearth.\" \"I wish we could have a fire,\" Bran said. \"I\'m cold. There\'s broken furniture down the stairs, I saw it. We could have Hodor chop it up and get warm.\" Hodor liked that idea. \"Hodor,\" he said hopefully. Jojen shook his head. \"Fire means smoke. Smoke from this tower could be seen a long way off.\" \"If there were anyone to see,\" his sister argued. \"There\'s a man in the village.\" \"One man.\" \"One man would be enough to betray Bran to his enemies, if he\'s the wrong man. We still have half a duck from yesterday. We should eat and rest. Come morning the man will go on his way, and we will do the same.\" Jojen had his way; he always did. Meera divided the duck between the four of them. She\'d caught it in her net the day before, as it tried to rise from the marsh where she\'d surprised it. It wasn\'t as tasty cold as it had been hot and crisp from the spit, but at least they did not go hungry. Bran and Meera shared the breast while Jojen ate the thigh. Hodor devoured the wing and leg, muttering \"Hodor\" and licking the grease off his fingers after every bite. It was Bran\'s turn to tell a story, so he told them about another Brandon Stark, the one called Brandon the Shipwright, who had sailed off beyond the Sunset Sea. Dusk was settling by the time duck and tale were done, and the rain still fell. Bran wondered how far Summer had roamed and whether he had caught one of the deer. Grey gloom filled the tower, and slowly changed to darkness. Hodor grew restless and walked awhile, striding round and round the walls and stopping to peer into the privy on every circuit, as if he had forgotten what was in there. Jojen stood by the north balcony, hidden by the shadows, looking out at the night and the rain. Somewhere to the north a lightning bolt crackled across the sky, brightening the inside of the tower for an instant. Hodor jumped and made a frightened noise. Bran counted to eight, waiting for the thunder. When it came, Hodor shouted, \"Hodor!\" I hope Summer isn\'t scared too, Bran thought. The dogs in Winterfell\'s kennels had always been spooked by thunderstorms, just like Hodor. I should go see, to calm him... The lightning flashed again, and this time the thunder came at six. \"Hodor!\" Hodor yelled again. \"HODOR! HODOR!\" He snatched up his sword, as if to fight the storm. Jojen said, \"Be quiet, Hodor. Bran, tell him not to shout. Can you get the sword away from him, Meera?\" \"I can try.\" \"Hodor, hush,\" said Bran. \"Be quiet now. No more stupid hodoring. Sit down.\" \"Hodor?\" He gave the longsword to Meera meekly enough, but his face was a mask of confusion. Jojen turned back to the darkness, and they all heard him suck in his breath. \"What is it?\" Meera asked. \"Men in the village.\" \"The man we saw before?\" \"Other men. Armed. I saw an axe, and spears as well.\" Jojen had never sounded so much like the boy he was. \"I saw them when the lightning flashed, moving under the trees.\" \"How many?\" \"Many and more. Too many to count.\" \"Mounted? \"No.\" \"Hodor.\" Hodor sounded frightened. \"Hodor. Hodor.\" Bran felt a little scared himself, though he didn\'t want to say so in front of Meera. \"What if they come out here?\" \"They won\'t.\" She sat down beside him. \"Why should they?\" \"For shelter.\" Jojen\'s voice was grim. \"Unless the storm lets up. Meera, could you go down and bar the door?\" \"I couldn\'t even close it. The wood\'s too warped. They won\'t get past those iron gates, though.\" \"They might. They could break the lock, or the hinges. Or climb up through the murder hole as we did.\" Lightning slashed the sky, and Hodor whimpered. Then a clap of thunder rolled across the lake. \"HODOR!\" he roared, clapping his hands over his ears and stumbling in a circle through the darkness. \"HODOR! HODOR! HODOR!\" \"NO!\" Bran shouted back. \"NO HODORING!\" It did no good. \"HOOOODOR!\" moaned Hodor. Meera tried to catch him and calm him, but he was too strong. He flung her aside with no more than a shrug. \"HOOOOOODOOOOOOOR!\" the stableboy screamed as lightning filled the sky again, and even Jojen was shouting now, shouting at Bran and Meera to shut him up. \"Be quiet!\" Bran said in a shrill scared voice, reaching up uselessly for Hodor\'s leg as he crashed past, reaching, reaching. Hodor staggered, and closed his mouth. He shook his head slowly from side to side, sank back to the floor, and sat cross-legged. When the thunder boomed, he scarcely seemed to hear it. The four of them sat in the dark tower, scarce daring to breathe. \"Bran, what did you do?\" Meera whispered. \"Nothing.\" Bran shook his head. \"I don\'t know.\" But he did. I reached for him, the way I reach for Summer. He had been Hodor for half a heartbeat. It scared him. \"Something is happening across the lake,\" said Jojen. \"I thought I saw a man pointing at the tower.\" I won\'t be afraid. He was the Prince of Winterfell, Eddard Stark\'s son, almost a man grown and a warg too, not some little baby boy like Rickon. Summer would not be afraid. \"Most like they\'re just some Umbers,\" he said. \"Or they could be Knotts or Norreys or Flints come down from the mountains, or even brothers from the Night\'s Watch. Were they wearing black cloaks, Jojen?\" \"By night all cloaks are black, Your Grace. And the flash came and went too fast for me to tell what they were wearing.\" Meera was wary. \"If they were black brothers, they\'d be mounted, wouldn\'t they?\" Bran had thought of something else. \"It doesn\'t matter,\" he said confidently. \"They couldn\'t get out to us even if they wanted. Not unless they had a boat, or knew about the causeway.\" \"The causeway!\" Meera mussed Bran\'s hair and kissed him on the forehead. \"Our sweet prince! He\'s right, Jojen, they won\'t know about the causeway. Even if they did they could never find the way across at night in the rain.\" \"The night will end, though. If they stay till morning...\" Jojen left the rest unsaid. After a few moments he said, \"They are feeding the fire the first man started.\" Lightning crashed through the sky, and light filled the tower and etched them all in shadow. Hodor rocked back and forth, humming. Bran could feel Summer\'s fear in that bright instant. He closed two eyes and opened a third, and his boy\'s skin slipped off him like a cloak as he left the tower behind... ... and found himself out in the rain, his belly full of deer, cringing in the brush as the sky broke and boomed above him. The smell of rotten apples and wet leaves almost drowned the scent of man, but it was there. He heard the clink and slither of hardskin, saw men moving under the trees. A man with a stick blundered by, a skin pulled up over his head to make him blind and deaf. The wolf went wide around him, behind a dripping thornbush and beneath the bare branches of an apple tree. He could hear them talking, and there beneath the scents of rain and leaves and horse came the sharp red stench of fear...');
